2,"I think this phone is the best in its segment.
But its not all perfect though.
It could have offered more 5g bands and gorilla glass 5 instead of panda glass.
Because i never heard of panda glass before.
I really don't know which one is stronger.",4.3
3,"I have purchased IQOO Z3 on 8 June 2021 in the launch sale and received it today that is 11 June 2021 at the price of Rs 17490. I think it is an apt price to buy for a mid-range buyer. I have initially thought that I would have to shell out Rs 19000 or more for this product. But on receiving the product at the above price range I got extremely delighted.

Though I have received the product today and my usage of 4-5 hour won't reflect the product experience fully. But whatever hour phone was with me. It was a wonderful experience. Right from touch, to OS, or camera everything is phenomenal. I would recommend everyone to go for it. At the above price range it better than even Oneplus CE Nord (though it is my opinion, it can vary for others) Screen though is not Amoled but has a refresh rate of 120 Hz and the UI is extremely fantastic.

I hope you all will find this product a value proposition for you.",4.3

5,"It's a Good Overall phone with Excellent in Hand feel as it's slim and light weight and packs a good 4400 mah battery which gives pretty amazing battery life and 55w charging is just blazing fast needless to say.

Display size is perfect but notch looks outdated, should have provided in display camera .
There's no amoled but colors are punchy , no complaints and 120 hz is very smooth and well optimised.

Speakers are pretty loud and earpiece is very loud and clear even at 50-60% volume.

Network and wifi quality is also very good.

Cameras are pretty good front n back both.
Even in night they click decent photos.

Processor is excellent and 5G ready , so that's a plus point.

Even the UI has improved a lot now , compared to previous one's this closer to stock android look is amazing and very smooth and fast, liked the vivo ui for 1st time, it's the biggest improvement.

The only con i could figure out is the outdated notch display , rest everything is perfect especially in hand feel.",4.3
6,"Excellent phone! The UI is very good, clean and responsive! The specs are really good at this time considering the specs offered by competition at this price. Display is very good despite being LCD. I personally love the colors & contrast of LCD over contrasty AMOLED panels in this price range and it's totally an individual's choice. Trust me, the display is excellent! Yes, every phone has some cons but it really doesn't matter. No phone can be perfect! Specs wise, this is the best phone to consider right now under 25k after Poco X3 pro. Samsung's GW3 Camera sensor is also good! These days, majority phones are delivering good cameras! I generally use GCAM mods to unleash the camera's true potential. A good overall package in this price!",4.3
7,"1st time to use IQOO brand, never experienced this much feel by using this phone with other brands

Pros:
Excellent camera
Battery back up
Charging time is very less
Display
Weight of phone
Performance
Sound quality
All games easy to handle
No heating issue
Very premium look

Cons:
Out put sound ,it is low
Not found any other major cons,

Overall good phone... Definitely feel good.",4.3
8,I was earlier using one plus 6(6gb ram version) and now upgraded to IQ OOz3 5G 8gb ram version. I can say that there are more pros than cons in this phone...display is great even it is LCD. I am using super amoled earlier but I find this screen comparable. Phone quality is good. Build quality suberb and battery backup great and very fast 55w charging with practical time from 10 percent to 100 percent in less than hour. Cons is speaker whose volume is not so loud but it is clear and videos can be watched easily,4.3
9,"Im one of those who ordered it immediately on the launch.However disappointed with amazon delivary, took 8days to deliver it.Recievedd the mobile with 30% charging which exausted in 3 hrs due to intial process of shifting data. As advertised charged 50%in 19 mins(66 wats flash charger) and later on slowed a bit eventually finishing the charging in 1 hr,Battery heats a little while charging. Screen is butter smooth, bright, refresh rate can be adjusted however i choose smart rate.Finger print reader is absolute fast..Battery easily last for a day or more for a moderate user.Few of the preinstalled apps can be uninstalled.As of now happy with the purchase..only cons found..Fun touch OS and camera.Though not 100% unhappy with camera however im not a ardent user of camera.",4.3
10,"It's literally the best phone in the market for this price bracket.

2. Very fast processor. It's a delight for gamers.
3. Amazing battery (Lasts entire day easily even after heavy usage and charges very quickly)
4. Camera ia AMAZING. Couldn't imagine such high quality camera from a phone of this price. Very clear and sharp. Even in low light it takes very clear pictures.

6. No heating issues.

Cons-
Couldn't see any as of now.",4.3

14,"I bought the phone on first day of sale at a good discount offer from icici bank. Got it for just 18500 for 8GB and 128 GB variant.
Camera - The camera is super awesome almost at par with GCam experience. Great night and daylight photography with sharp edges and color reproduction.
Processor- The processor 768G of Snapdragon is the latest one with many future updates and configurations. It is superfast in all aspects, really loved scrolling through menu, pages and screens. Playing games is great coz you can play in highest settings with zero lags.
Screen - Coming to the screen, it is very bright and feels immersive. Touch is very responsive and smooth. You will enjoy playing games and watching movies. The screen is light on eye and easy to watch.
Sensors- It has all the sensors and the finger print is lightning fast, you just touch it and it unlocks no waiting even for a single second with super accuracy.
Network - There is carrier aggregation, Calls and everything is stable and has high range for network. Data speed and hotspot works great. The screen mirroring feature is also there. The SAR value is also within limits.
Battery - Charging time is only about 55 minutes for 0-100%. The battery stays on for whole day and more with all the surfing, gaming, music, calls and videos.
Hope 5G comes soon will love to try 5G in this.
I was skeptical as I have never used brands apart from samsung, nokia or apple but I made a great choice with Iqoo by Vivo.

All in all go ahead its the real premium offering of Iqoo from Vivo.",4.3

16,"Well i was looking for a budget phone with good display camera and performance ..
And now after using this phone continuously I'm totally satisfied. It fulfilled all my requirement

I know display is not Amoled but trust me colours of this phone are damn superb and you won't miss Amoled at all .

Snapdragon 768 name is enough it's a gaming beast no heating issue.

0 to 60% charged in 26 minutes pretty impressive .

Primary censor is good and others are decent in my opinion . Night mode is great .
Video 4K 60fps very impressive .

Speaker is Mono but sound is crisp and clear .
Overall performance is very good I'm satisfied.

Today i compared it's display with One Plus Nord 1 (Amoled) and for me Iqoo was better because of 120HZ refresh rate as i said you won't miss Amoled colours are too good.

In hand feel and overall look is superb. Loved it ‚ù§Ô∏è

Atlast i will say if you're looking for a phone under 20K with fast charging great performance then yes it's for you i must say this phone is smoothest .",4.3
17,"I bought it for just 14540/- with exchange of my phone.
Pros
For that price it is more than what you want
The display is one of the best in IPS LCD and can be compared to Amoled
The sound quality is more than decent
The battery is kind of decent as I am a heavy user so gave me about 5-6 hrs of SOT
There is headphone jack for gamers
Charging speed is just awesome
Camera is decent

Till now I am more than satisfied.",4.3
18,"Overall the device is good, this is the first handset to powered by the all new Qualcomm Snapdragon 768 5G SoC with 120Hz display under 18k budget.

Pros.
1. Viewing angles and color reproduction are amazing and can't believe it's an LCD panel
2. Can switch three different refresh rate presets including 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz
3. Decent charging speed, thanks to 55 Watt charger
4. Good selfie camera

Cons.
1. Low audio output
2. Poor haptic feedback
3. Few Bloatware
4. Average rear camera performance

Will update my review after a month to list any deficiencies if noticed.",4.3
19,"Fingerprint scanner-9.5/10
Battery üîã-9.5/10
Charging speed-19mins 53% too fast
Pubg smooth+extreme little FPS drops when 2-3squads nearby, needs little more optimisation to less fps drop.

Overall UI is faster n better than any other UI, better than REDMI devices.

I prefer if u r buying under 20k beast device, then close ur eyes, don't see any review, go for it, u won't regret after buying it.

Thank u ‚ù§Ô∏è

20,"Ordered this for my nephew, my main concern was pubg performance. Thankfully works butter smooth with no heating at all. Only concern is tons of pre installed app which can't be removed. Amazon delivered it within 24 hours of launch. Overall satisfactory purchase.",4.3
21,"Phones in last few years have become all about camera. Offer higher megapixel, show some night photography and you get a device for more than a laptop, 2 wheelers or even best of TVs. The madness had to stop! The sensible is here!

Pros:
1. Reputed superb quality Snapdragon processor
2. Screen response rate automatically adjusts to your usage - upto 120hz!
3. Good battery, superb quick charge & cooling ensures phone doesn't heat up - hence preserving life of the battery
4. Good customization of OS, some v handy features
5. Good placement of fingerprint sensor which is lightening fast

Cons:
Just slightly on the heavier side (comparable to most phones though). Rest will know after more usage

But overall a serious contender for even 30k phones!",4.3
22,"the phone is really good in its price range,
the camera is above average,
processor(phone) is very fast in day to day life and also gives good gaming performance,
I got 8GB 128GB variant so I had no issues in app management or ram management,
The design of cyber blue is awesome and very eye attractive,
120hz refresh rate give you scrolling experience very smooth and there is no lag shutter in my case,
OS gives you feeling of having a stock android experience,
fingerPrint and FaceUnclock is really fast and works fine.
Battery life depends on the usage, for me it gives 10-11 hours easily, I play BGMI and COD for at least 2-3 hours and then day to day apps, and still it gives this much of battery life which is really good

I'll highly recommend to buy it, you will not regret it.
at a price of 18550(after 2500/- discount from amazon), i think its one of the best phone you can get,",4.3
23,"The best smartphone inbthis range, one of its kind for sure. I will recommend the same to everyone. Just see the selfie uploaded, without making any changes in the settings I have clicked the first pic with my daughter. The best phone in this segment",4.3
24,"I read many negative reviews here. But I wanted to try. Hence, I ordered the phone on 21 Oct at the Great Indian Festival (Rs.18,990) and received next day. Extreme fast delivery! I am updating this review after usage of 4 days:

I thought of trying Iqoo Z3, I have got it for 12k along with bank and exchange offers!

I bought it without confidence but this proved me wrong!

This really lives up to the expectation!

I am happy with the purchase ü•≥ü§óü§©!

1. Quick charge.
2. Long lasting battery life.
3. Speed.
4. Camera (can't compare with iPhone üòÉ, but reasonable).
5. Latest OS with 5G support.

I learn that spending 50k or more on a mobile is not wise but paying 15k on a mobile is a smart decision!",4.3
26,"First Thing I want to Tell You that,i got it at 16490Rs,with all bank cards offer.And here are my opinions and verdict..

Design-I have ordered Cyber blue variant 6/128gb ,and it looks very good with shiny rainbow effect.Many are complaining about fingerprint smudges at the back,but i know all consumers dont use their phone without cases.and that not be counted as a con.Because Phone Is Very very lightweighted with great weight balance, and very comfortable to hold.At this price range ,it is very awesome.

Processor - Speeeedddd ,that all i want to tell u , it is blazing fast. I got at 16.5k and i can prove u ,it is the fastest ohone in the segment except poco x3 pro,because u will get 732g,mt800u in this price with only 64 gb rom. Except poco x3 pro ,but it is very very heavy phone and with heating issues and throttled performance. I can say poco x3 pro is a bhari bharkam dabba,only for secondary uses as gaming.And Yes I am a Bgmi ppaye4,it handles best in the segment..and it is more better than 1+ nord tooo..

DISPLAY-This is something which is pros or con for someone.If You are using amoled display device then u feel the difference(not too much,works well in outdoors too).But If you are not using anoled's,it definitely feels you like amoled(bcoz it is better ips display when u customisze it ).120 HZ IS WORKING VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE,I HAVE compared Narzo 30 pro 120hz display vs iqoo ,and you will feel the real flagship like snoothness.

CAMERA-Camera is descebt,One thing really very like is its stabilisation ,best in the segment as conpared to 1+ nord,even x7 max,it is best camera under 20k,many youtuber reviewed it as average camera ,bcoz they uses flagship phones as primary but it is much better at this segment.

Battery-I used only 2 days,and it giver many impressive results like 5000mah battery,with 4400mah battery,not bother it 66w charger is in the box and device supports 55w and get quick charged in minutes.I think it takes some minutes less than 1hr to full charge 0-100%,but i know no one drop battery below 30% it means 30 min. Of charge is ebough for full charge..

MAJOR ISSUES I FACED IT IN THE DEVIC3 IS WHEN U BOOT UP FIRST TIME AND OPEN ANY APP IT NEED YOUR PERMISSION (IQOO TERMS AND POLICIES) TO WORK(all preinstalled apps,like dialer,contacts messages and even camera) IT FEELS WEIRD AND ANNOYING,BTW YOU CAN DISABLE CAMERA ,LOCATION AND PHONE PERMISSIONS IN SETTING)

SUMMING UP ALL IT IT IS THE BEST AND BEST SMARTPHONE IN THE SEGMENT,I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY AT 19990RS WAIT FOR SALES AND SAVE MORE..
LIKE FOR MY PATIENCE...üòÇ",4.3
27,"I really liked the phone. Although it doesn't have any extra feature, however the 120Hz refresh rate plus SD 768 makes the usage experience butter smooth. Screen quality is much better than other LCDs and support 4K streaming. Speaker sound is okay, camera is decent- dont expect them outstanding. Portrait camera is however quite good. Lastly, I loved the battery- lasted 3 days after first charge with normal call and whatsapp usage. The transparent back cover is of good quality and screen protector came fixed. Phone is quite big but feels light. Overall good product, only if you prefer battery and user experience good. More than gaming, I found it good for woeking professionals.",4.3
28,"What i notice good in this phone as compared to my old poco x2.
1. Network reception was better ..
I'm able to use my phone with no problem where as poco x2 faceing lot of problems
2. Lite in weight and in hand feel is good not feel cheap in any condition.
3. Final and my reason to change poco is miui.
This funtouch os is lot better than miui its almost same as vivo ui / realme ui don't buy oneplus for this reason its good not like memeuiüòÇ
No lag or hang issue(no heating)
Optimization is done very well battery and smoothness is top notch.
Ad and boatware is available but you can unistall or if you want complite clean that also posible via adb tool.(no necessary to do i think)

Cons
1. Don't buy this for camera or display
Both are descent but not top notch.
2.only limited 5g band",4.3
29,"It's very nice mobile phone with its price range
Pros:
1. Camera parameters is very good
2. Battery is long last for a day
3. Features is cool
4. Charging it's very fast with in half an hour it's get charge from 14 to 100 percent
5. Security features is also nice
6. Every day I use use approximately 18 hrs by playing, watching movies ect. It didn't get heating
Cons
1. Display it's lcd screen but looks good if it comes in amoled it's very nice but touch works very fast
2. Sound is dts only not dolnay automs
3. Vivo has to work on advertisement block some time advertisement are irritating.

Although this mobile is awesome in this price range",4.3
30,"My experience with IQOO Z3 10+ days of heavy day to day usage with gaming, streaming, Multi-tasking & taking pictures etc.. IQOO have done a very good job that they introduce *Snapdragon 768G* processor! (Which is overclocked version of 765g). The processor is really amazing, no lag issue found by playing extreme fps in BGMi, but if you use hdr graphics its doesn't support 60 fps then, and in hotdrops it will lag then. But trust me in extreme fps you will enjoy the game more than hdr graphics.. I Have played COD at very high graphics with max frame rate, Fortnite at Epic HD graphics, genshin Impact in HIGHEST graphics! (Play Asphalt 9 with this smartphone you can see the gaming experience and graphics is far better than other smartphones except poco x3 pro which is *only best for gaming*). It has also 5g support. There are 2 bands (n77 & n78) but it doesn't support dual 5g sim standby. And in carrier aggrigation, it only have 1 band! And not stable but like others poco m3 pro/x3/x3 pro, redmi note 10 pro max , nord CE supports 2 bands and very stable! That was disappointing! But 4g network is very good like i get in my area 15-30 mbps download speed and 1.5-2+ mbps upload speed using Vi sim card. Well, yeah it is also a very good camera smartphone at this price! [ I mean you can easily compare with Mi 10i, redmi note 10 pro max, samsung f62, poco x3 pro etc cameras. There are many features and beauty modes in camera like- potrait mode ideas of pose in potrait mode, for girls there is makeup filters, Ai stickers, live photo, 4k 60fps, slow motion supports 1080p-120fps & 720p-240fps!, standard stabilization & Ultra stabilization (EIS), 10x zoom, many filters, styles, light effects etc. ] and comes with 3 primary camera 64 mp main,8 mp ultra wide and 2 mp macro. The macro camera is not at all good at this price.. quanlity of pictures are very blurry and warmth! And yeah it supports Google Camera also! The display IPS is quite veryy better than other ips displays.. which is 120hz refresh rate (you can also choose from options- 60hz, 90hz, 120hz & smart switch) and 180hz of touch sampling, for display's better enhancement you can choose screen color as ""bright"". The costcutting is here that it doesn't get AMOLED screen and sterio speakers! The speaker is decentüòê but using headset (also comes with Bluetooth 5.1 support) you can get ""deepfield audio effects"" ! The design is also quite a good looking stylish smartphone.. the sides are made of aluminium not metal and the back is not glass (for my suggestion glass back will much costly you break that glass) it comes with better polycarbonate back which is better than samsung plastic backs.. for more protection you can use carbon fibre sticker and transparent glass back cover for more good looking and safety! The battery backup is average 4500 mah ( very closed to nord CE for 7-10 minutes) but the best thing that company gives is - the charger is 67 watt but the phone supports 55 watt and charge reallllyyyyyyyyyy fast.. (remember fast charge will work using this phones usb which is 55 watt support usb). The ram management is awesommeeeee! At 6 gb/8 gb varients you can extend them up to 1 gb/ 3 gb more ram! It means 6 gb =7 gb and 8 gb = 11 gb! And UFS 2.2 storage speed! It supports 2 sim (1 hybrid & 1 nano sim) or 1 sim 1 sd card (up to 512gb). Phone is not heavy, 184 grams only. side monted fingerprint sensor which is Reallyyyyyy very fast! It also have 3.5 mm audio jack. Overall there is No Lag, Not getting heating issue (i mean the 5 layer vapour cooling is work like flagship smartphone) and yeah play every game with highest graphics! With gaming features like 4d vibration, eSports mode, Eagle Eye Enhancement etc. Some-people say the funtouch UI is not clean but for my opinion- read the privacy policy or some settings you can easily disable bloatwares! So don't just listen every problems on this device, the device is far better than nord CE and other smartphones at 20000 price! The best midrange *gaming smartphone* is- poco x3 pro BUT FOR BEST GAMING AND CAMERA AND DAILY DAY TO DAY USAGE THE IQOO Z3 LEADS! WORTH IT!‚ù§Ô∏è The carrier aggrigation and camera bugs will be better by getting a software update so don't be panic.. and don't upset about ips screen! If you compare side by side with amoled than you can see the difference is very small and the waterdrop notch is not old.. it looks really good at this! (For my option apple iphone doesn't get any notch in 1 lakh price so this 20k phone get waterdrop notch ok) So you can easily buy this smartphone without any hesitation!üôÇ my Last update as we know Vivo's sub-brand is IQOO, so don't worry about phone servicing; vivo service centre will also service the iqoo smartphones veryy soon !",4.3

I am fully surprised because vivo service center employee saying it cant be repaired..only solution is replacement of damage item..So surprised moment...Now my phone is doing work as same before..in this

36,"I would like to tell the pros and cons here
Pros -
1. It has a 768g 5g processor which makes phone a great performance packed phone.
2. It contains a 64mp AI triple camera and having a 16mp selfish camera which works very well.
3. It has 120hz touch display rate so the phone works smooth and fast as well as the combination of 768g processor and 120hz display rate makes the phone superfast.
4. The battery is of 4400 MaH but it contains a 55w superfast charger which charges the phone 100% in only 40 minutes so the battery recharges fast.
5. RAM is 8gb + 3GB so we can get 11GB RAM in this phone as the RAM is extended.
6. It also contain a liquid cooling system which prevents the phone from heating and it can be considered as a good phone for gaming.
7. It has side mounted fingerprint sensor which takes 0.2 seconds hardly to unlock the phone.
Cons -
The only con for this phone is that it does not have the super amoled display it contains LCD screen but it is also good for this phone and works well.",4.3
37,"The best hardware you can get for 20k !!
The back is plastic but it's somewhat scratch resistant so it's good
The bloatware iss very less and if you uninstall it using ADB no one can tell the difference between oxygen OS and this funtouch os .
The camera is pretty decent
Speakers are not good but I use headphones mostly all the time so not an issue for me
The performance mind-blowing, 120hz works flawlessly , the gaming mode is very good and have some very good features
Most of the time it support 4g+
The battery life and charging speed is out of the world, it could easily last for a day with casual gaming also .
Overall it's a very good package !!",4.3
38,"IT IS THE SUPERIOR PHONE ON THIS PRICE SEGMENT.

Looks Good But Lacks An Identity. There's a clear lack of distinctive personality and a new gradient finish isn't going to make a huge difference. 2021 is all about affordable 5G smartphones. Every other smartphone in India, or the world, this year will be a 5G phone. And, a major chunk of these future-proof devices will be shipped by BBK Electronics, the worlds' largest phone maker from China. Notably, the tech giant offers smartphones under three major brands in India with their sub-brands operating as separate entities. These include Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus as main brands, and Realme and iQOO now working as separate brands under Oppo and Vivo respectively.",4.3

 Received IQOO Z3 just 2days ago.
I don't know if it is the best phone in the segment as I have not used the other competitors as of this moment.
All I know is that it should definitely be one of the best in market.
I am trying to get a hand on clicking decent pictures, the Camera is genuinely superb hands down. Lot of modes you get with the Camera which as an avid ex Samsung User I feel is a big change. Low light photography is good enough. The UI is good, faced lags twice for split seconds and I feel the touch could be a little better but it is still pretty decent enough. Being an ex Samsung User I am used to Fast Touch response but IQOO Z3 doesn't disappoint either. Faced two screen freezes and was pushed out of Whatsapp once. The sound from the speakers is a little sublime but doesn't break at high volume. The apps are organised. It is great when it comes to playing games. Have not faced any heating issues. The dart charging or fast charging is probably the only downside as the 55W charger to charge 50% in 19mins is actually not true takes over an hour to fully charge. Takes over 15hours to discharge after complete charging with moderate use. The phone has a good feel in hand and is slightly larger bulky and slightly heavier so you do feel it is kind of premium.
Overall the processor is fast. UI could be fully bug free in future. Easy to set up. Speakers are good. Phone Doesn't heat. The camera is the best part of the phone. You can click high depth clear pics with full colors closest to what your eyes can see and so many modes make it a mobilegrapher's delightful.
The chassis colors are great. The black isn't matte black but rather is a glossy lead black which often gives off bluish hues under light.
With little downsides and more advantages it is definitely a phone I am sure many users would recommend.
I received an added Rs.1500 discount on the phone so for me personally it is a gem of a bargain.
It comes with a scratch proof film and a back cover too.",4.3
40,"I bought this beast in Amazon's GIF 2021 for 16.8k after exchange of an old smart phone and bank CC discount. Remember this is for 8GB RAM / 256GB Storage option. It'd have been a true flagship slayer if it additionally came with:
1. OLED display
2. Dual-SIM and dedicated micro SD slot. Right now, it has an hybrid slot.
3. 11+ 5G bands - believe it currently supports only 2.
4. An IR Blaster option (wishful?!)
5. A higher resolution and usable 3rd camera.
6. No bloatware, crappy system apps that cannot be uninstalled or disabled.

Strengths:
1. Buttery quick performance.
2. Excellent 120hz display, thought LCD. Also, has multiple refresh rate option. Simply brilliant.
3. Excellent main and 2nd wide angle camera. Supports 4k 60p videos on the main rear camera which is outstanding.
4. Decent battery performance thought rated at 4.4mAH but charges super fast with the supplied charger.

Excellent but not perfect - to sum it up!",4.3
41,"Well mobile is good if you're buying mobile for speed network it's for you carrier aggregation is very good
Camera performance is satisfactory
Gaming is smooth even on 90 fps and max graphics
Jovi home is very useful for daily use
Con's:
Phone is not so secure : your details is stored in vivo data base for over 3 year's as per terms so be careful while signing in the phone try to avoid all bloatware installed don't use the local browser
Change the chrome home setting to default from the vivo home page",4.3
42,"Iqoo z3 delivered to me on 11 june , first of all i have tested the camera the camera quality is to good and it supports 1080p with 60 fps video recording and having stability in video while walking , all people wants pubg review i have played pubg for an hour in smooth-extreme the gameplay is too smooth but sometimes little frame rates drops but that's not a big issue , the temperature after 1 hour gaming is almost 41 degree celcius , the battery does not drain too much , if someonw has lag issue in iqoo z3 you can have a cooler facing the mobile as well as you, the mobile gets full charge in nearly 50 minutes ,at last but not the least i can say u guys can go for it",4.3
43,"So here I'm using this phone from last 5 days.
Camera of this phone is good but video stabilization isn't good. Charging speed is very good but battery backup is average. Main pro of this phone is SN 768 G processor. This works very well and give a good experience while using this phone. Extra features like game mode and all are also very good. Video recording of game is also very good. Captures good quality videos and sound. And some cons are - compromise in built, single speaker, and it is without amoled screen. But after all look of this phone is very good and fell good in hands. So in my opinion this is a very good phone according to this price of 20k",4.3
44,"Writing this review after using the phone for 2 days that
Cons
1 Best Performance
2 Good battery life
3 Good Display

Pros
1 OS could be better",4.3
45,"Pros-
Fingerprint or Battery good
Performance very good

Cons-
phone back side plastic
iQOO Z3 comes with a Polycarbonate body. If you look at the back panel of the Ace Black colour variant of the phone, it gives a shiny and glossy touch even though there is no glass panel present. If we look at the overall frame, it is a plastic frame.(becz, 5 layer cooling system)

display not super amoled
IPS LCD, HDR 10+(but okey iqoo z3 display)

Sound Quality not very good(cutting price)",4.3
46,"IQOO Z3 is jist awesome. At first my first priority was amoled display and in-display fingerprint sensor but after seeing the reviews of the users and youtubers, although this device doesn't have amoled and in-display fingerprint sensor I purchased this device and I am glad that I selected this device.
It has Funtouch OS which is awesome. No lags at all. No ads. And 120 hrz refresh rate do not lag at all. There are many devices with 120 hrz display in this proce point but they all lag at some point but not this one.
Pros -
Performance - I played Pubg for total of 5 hrs with Smooth and extreme settings and for this price it was awesome. Yes frame drops were there but im this price point can't complain. And in day to day usage I can tell you THIS PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD.

Camera - Well to be honest I don't use camera so much but for me it is Superb. It can record 4K 60FPS.

UI - Funtouch OS is better than MIUI AND COLOR OS. Funtouch OS improved so much in past couple of years. Many great features with smoothness.

Cons -

Display - It is not amoled display so... Its display is not bad (don't take it wrong) but amoled display is much better than LCD displays.

No oleophobic coating - because there is no oleophobic coating display is oily everytime ( if you are not using any screen guard). If you are using a screenguard than you won't feel this.

CONCLUSION -
IF YOU WANT BEST OVERALL DEVICE WITH NO ISSUES THAN BUY THIS MONSTER. THIS IS THE BEST DEVICE IN TERMS OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE. (AND YES I KNOW SD860 IS ALSO OUT THERE BUT REMEMBER THAT DEVICE IS COMING WITH MIUI WHICH CAN LAG ANY DEVICE)",4.3
47,"i think, this is the best and fastest Android Phone I have prichased and used so far. I have been using Xiaomi Phones so far, normally, the Redmi Note Pro series. While I do not have mcuh complaint against Xiaomi phones except that they were bulky, heavier and I was not really comfortable with their Note 9 pro max and was looking to change it. This IQOO Z3 was a good deal for me, with rpice, size and weight. I still find the weight on little higher side, I would have preferred if it had weight of say 170g or so.
Its blazing fast ( for my normal Twitter/facebook posts as well as news apps readings.
I dont play games or watch Netflix on it, but occassinaly watch Youtube and those works great. I dont listen music using mobile phone speakers too. And it takes fairly good picturs on emergencies. For real photography, I always prefer Canon 5D Mark 3.",4.3

49,"After using the samsung M31S which was a disaster i was forced to purchased this IQOO from VIVO. This is an amazing product with camera, processor, storage, call connectivity, etc very awesome. I am really sarisfied infact very happy that i have decided to purchase this mobile. Thanks Vivo",4.3
50,"NQA return policy is the biggest challenge IQOO put this in competitive market. Delivery was super fast. Here is the day 2 experience, will share more details after couple of days.
One single word if need to say - all rounder.

Pros:
1. Awesome Performance
2. Charger with 55W
3. Decent Camera with and without light
4. I read many reviews but when experienced FunTouch isn‚Äôt bad overall.
Cons:
1. Needs to be have AMOLED instead of LED
2. In display biometric would have been great
3. Water drop notch for front camera gives old look
4. Battery drain bit fast seems 120hz is the culprit and don‚Äôt have option to set at lower refresh rate.

I don‚Äôt want to judge about 5G bands provided by different handsets now a days, as we don‚Äôt know how and when it get sorted in future.",4.3
51,"Hi, bought it on 1st day of sale got it on 11 th no reviews were posted when bought,for this, now why i bought this?
Because it doesn't come with miui, to be true, (do note funtouch os also have some wierd terms and condition from app drawer search to etc places in device, which is something of concern, this makes these chinese brand loose their trust, it better than miui as software experience is ad free but bloat ware still there, like jovi,vivo store, vivo security app etc. Iqoo if you really listening you need to change all these stop giving bloatwares or atleast option to disable it and who ask to agree terms and condition when using phone launcher etc fix these or use stock android launcher) value for money hardware-wise product/s are still offered by Xiaomi, but 'miui' is worse software experince ever, no matter which processor you get, then there are ads...... Poco make this better as ads are not there but then it lacks camera quality,period. And it still got 'miui'(they (Xiaomi) even remove support for devices to early)
Update 26/06/2021: i noticed one more con here the device 4g i think only supports 1800mhz for airtel, and due to this call breaks/drops at time indoor and also no carrier aggregation i.e. 4g+ or lte+ indoors. (Not sure issue with airtel or device voice cracking or drop is seen sometimes )

Now coming to points why buy this?
1. If you can ignore tear drop and ok with lcd display, then belive me display is quite nice with 120 hz refresh rate makes it premium (and even if you buy an amoled display under 20k you will not get AlwayOnDisplay, so it defeats the purpose)
2. If POCO f1 speaker was ok for you then this will be also fine sounds nearly same in decibels,(no stereo speaker here)
3. Camera specially the primary and selfie are outstanding in this price range and camera app is optimised perfectly, pictures are natural, hdr is actually the Usp here, and selfie are very detailed, wide angle is ok, macro- usable, lowlight primary and selfie do ok but if little lighting is there for subject hdr pulls the job nicely here( hoping future sftware update dnt mess this)
4. Fast charge 55 w is pure epic and battery backup(easy 5-6 hr sot)
5. OS is well optimsed and peform better than sd 860 with miui in poco, but gpu lacks so gaming is ok but nt as gud as sd860. Note:sd860 is rebranded 855 so its still couple of year old cpu.
6. Better package than one+ nord ce(in all specs) and note 10 pro max(camera wise), (if you can ignore few funtouch OS issues)
7. If you want call recorder that dnt announce call is getting recorded ü§£ ( India dnt require call recording announcement by law still google dialer do it and all brands put google dialer in most global varient of devices to save money on software development)

Why not to buy?
1. If you consume lots of content purely, dnt buythis get amoled display (period) plus stero speaker device.(note 10 /pro/max)
2. 5G is really a gimmik dnt tempt for only that.
3. Camera is not your priority (because it got good camera but since it got lcd screen it might look not upto the mark but trust me it is)/or want as a secondary device.
4. Pure gaming (go for x3 pro poco only if budget under 20k)
5. Funtouch os is far better than miui but still got bloatware and unnecessary system permisions.(can be removed though and permissions can be denied unlike MIUI)
6. Plastic back (doesn't feel that premium in hand) looks gud but.

UPDATE: received 1st ota update today(17 jun 2021), they gave may security patch, fixed 3rd party apps lag issue, they fixed sleep battery backup ( have to see since device was already giving quiet good battery standby backup) and camera focus issue for close subjects now able to focus even on extreme close subjects, hdr looks improved alot in low light, so far things working good. This update shows the camera hardware is very capabale, as software optimisation is actually showing diff on camera results.",4.3

About product
Good points:
Nice camera..clear images... satisfied
Night mode...amazing
Fast...very fast charging...highly satisfied
Processor.... smooth and powerful
Good light weight design... highly satisfied
Volume...clear

Below points can be considered while taking decision
1. Battery. Could have been 5000
2. Volume loud but not pleasent
3. Themes wallpapers needs to buy
4. It's user interface could have been better. Samsung M31 is better than this.

Minor difference in display..compared to Amoled display. Ok.

Overall using bank offers as well as exchange,this is great deal.

To sum up, better than other mobiles around 16/17k",4.3
53,"Mind blowing camera. Charging speed and battery backup is superb. Ui average.
Little tall but it's very handy. Touch response awesome.
Just 2 days review. Will update after few days.
Few apps are especially Google Chrome not updating. Same reported tried multiple troubleshooting steps. Waiting for their update.
Sound is average not even comparable with my 4 years old Asus zenfone 3.",4.3
54,"Let's start with the cons:

1. Plastic back so fingerprints are inevitable.
2. Display average.
3. Single speaker. Sound very low.
4. OS has many useless app (some can be deleted).
5. The scary part is the 'Useless apps' needs access to your LOCATION, CONTACTS and STORAGE which is a security risk.
6. Display is 'Teardrop' which is outdated in today's standards.
7. The camera fails to capture the Bokeh effect in portrait mode. The aperture resets itself everytime.

Pros:
1. The fingerprint issue can be avoided by the durable cover that is provided.
2. The Useless apps access can be denied. I did it for mine and everything seems to work fine as of now.
3. The phone comes with a 66W Vivo Flashcharge and a 55W USB cable Type-C.
4. Charges phone to 50% under 20-25 mins.
5. I play COD and the game runs flawlessly thanks to the processor.
6. Minimum heating. Never felt it during gaming but while charging the top portion of the phone heats up but that's fine. At least you know the phone will get full charged by 55ish minutes. In the meantime go take a break!
7. The price is reasonable.
8. If you are looking for a budget gaming phone this can do the job. And IQOO has announced 2 years of System update and 3 years of Security update.
9. Apart from the Bokeh issue it is a quite decent camera.

Verdict: If you can ignore the fingerprint, display, speaker, the useless apps, the old teardrop screen and the Bokeh issue than this is the phone to go with. If you are mainly looking for the below features for your next phone than you are at the right place.

a) Ram: 8GB+ 3GB expandable
b) Storage: 256GB
c) Charging: 66W brick; 55W Datacable; 4400mah; 55ish mins.
d) Processor

I hope this piece of info be useful while you take the final decision.",4.3

56,"Got my phone delivered just yesterday. Here is a one day review. Phone feels nice. Great camera. A little heavy but not bothersome. (Or maybe I think it's heavy because my last phone weighed practically nothing). Fingertouch sensor and facial recognition works fast and works well. The back body is not glass but appears glass. I like that, as one thing which I don't like is visible fingerprints on my phone. No heating issues. The touch is super fast. Good sensor.

Only a few bugs like while using Netflix, for an initial 1 min or so, the video hangs a little. Never faced anything like that in any of my other phones. But I am sure company will get rid of it soon. Will update.

Update:

I have been using this phone for over a week now. Charges really really fast. Good battery backup. Goes on for more than 24 hours. Great camera. Night vision clicks some really good pictures. Overall phone is nice. I have reduced the refresh rate to 60hz. Phone is big in size but doesn't feel that heavy.

59,"Reviewing after 25 days , Basically I just bought iQOo Z3 because of the specs they have provided. So I never used Vivo or iQOo before. This is my first time testing out. I am actually surprised with the smartphone

So let's start with pro's which I liked

1. Battery is wow. Because I did not expect to have a decent battery life. I did not face any issues. And more over charge time to 100 is less than 48 min everytime for me.
2. Performance. Small beast it is. You can run every game which most of us play like BGMI, Pubg mobile and free fire call of duty etc. I did not face any lags or stutters with high graphics settings too. And this Snapdragon 768G is really well optimised one.
3. Better call quality and signal. I used realme before Jio struggle to get network where I stay I won't find even 1 point in tower so I miss many calls. But with iQOo it's better not great or extra ordinary but still I get tower and calls which I never miss. And audio quality is super no proximity issues. Go to for calls and audio
4. Display I am ok with a better IPS LCD display than worst amoled display which most of the brands are giving right now. No issues with display it's butter smooth with 120hz refresh rate. A decent display. And I don't have issues with water drop notch.
5. Camera is decent for this price. It's better than realme which I used before. After I updated the phone even the focus issues is fixed. So camera is a decent one.
6. No ads. Lots of customisation options. Fun OS. I like it.
7. No heating issues. Really the liquid cooling is awesome. Maximum temp was 38 but it gets reduced so fast. U won't find it for a longer minute. Really super optimised.

Real cons I don't like about this smartphone

1. Phone protection. No gorilla glass. So careful. Why iQOo missed it no idea. But I am disappointed with protection.
2. Netflix doesn't have HDR as of now. Where as other smartphone does support HDR. Hope they fix with update.
3. Single speaker. It's loud but not upto stereo speakers level. And if u play games without headphones then ur audio might muffle because of u holding the phone.
4. Low light camera is worst.

Conclusion.
If you need a decent battery life and decent camera and decent performance with good call and audio quality it's a decent smartphone to buy.

But if u need more than this. Try something else. But I am 100% sure this is way better than other smartphone which has heating issues and display issues and so many ads.",4.3
60,"Price is very reasonable.
256 GB storage is not not available in most of the phone.
Screen display is good but brightness is little low.
Camera does not take clear picture of any text in close up, it become blur in the corners. Low light photo is not good. All other functions are good. Colours of camera is good.
Battery life is less after full charge, it discharges before 12 hours continous use.
Charger is excellent, it charge the phone fully within 1 hour.

It's been three days since I am using this and belive me , it's still 18% battery left after using music and browsing all stuffs on phone, few videos on youtube. 66w charger - one hour full charge from 31% intial day.

62,"I liked the 7 days no-question guarantee return policy and was thinking to return if I do not like it till then.

I bought this product for my day2day use and I found its good till today. Following are my overall evaluation during these period.

Even it is 4400mah battery it is lasting long and charging fast. I have got 66w adapter in the package which I should not. Because I know phone will accept with higher watt and only consume 55w as required.

Fun touch performance is good after getting the update.

I felt little slow sometime with finger reader. Possibly it may be due improper biometric scan configuration.
Multiple apps and games are working fine without any hitch.
Even it is not sAmoled display quality is also good.

Cons:
-----
- Gorilla glass not used
- Would be great demanding with super Amoled display and dedicated SD slot with dual sim slot
- Alexa feature not available",4.3
63,"Pros: Awesome Camera, Awesome Performance, gaming experience is really out of the box in this phone. Fast charging, I guess I only charge it for 30-40 minutes. Network Connectivity is very good and yes there is option for 5G. Build quality is very premium. Display is not too great but you will get options to select in between 60hz, 90hz and 120hz (Don't believe on those who say this option is not available, I have checked it myself in my phone)
Cons: Many options missing in the settings like disabling notification bar in lockscreen, private safe is missing, data used is not shown in notification bar (you will have to keep checking yourself). Oppo and realme phones are more privacy focused and they really work on their software too, other than the hardware.
Battery drains very fast, if you are a heavy user, just fast charging prevents this phone from becoming a landline. I guess if LED display was used in it, instead of LCD, probably could last a day on heavy usage.
Verdict: Phone is good but you will have to live with some problems as I mentioned. I just hope, Vivo fixes given problems through update.",4.3

68,Phone is very nice. Processor is awesome but while gaming i feel some frame drops in higher graphics and the display quality is ok. I expect more at this price at least they have to offer a gorilla glass protection on screen so at least phones display will not be broken easily.,4.3

Problem exists in software, specially with camera software, color reproduction is very bad, specially in low light, noisy images. Also lot of concern with camera settings, it seem the device is unable to remember last settings, due to which u have to set it every time u click a photo. Heat management is awsome though. Gaming performance top notch. Camera and display is only trade off, even samsung phone in 12k range has better display than this one. If you have used amoled before u will feel the difference otherwise good to go. Build quality is good too, dropped few times with provided case,no scratch or any such.

Corn:
1.Big number of bloatware is pre-installed and most of them can't remove and ask each and every permission. evermore forcing you to sign the agreement to use that aap. It feels scary.
while phone setup time, It took more than 1 hour to cancel all this junk aap permission.
2.Funtouch OS required a lot of refinement. For example the Dark mode we can't schedule it. Redmi phone have this option and it's great.
3.Auto brightness is working but it always keeps lower brightness than required, every time I have to adjust manually
4.Single speaker and it is not even louder.

The display is a good one, I am ok with its notch.",4.3

The screen quality is good but the screen is dull
You have to keep the brightness in full to watch the videos in youtube ,prime,Netflix which is quite irritating and consume battery .
2. The fingerprint sensor is not wide ,it's thin in size ,So you have to position your finger and adjust for unlock which is quite annoying as well.
3. The speaker is decent the sound quality is not good enough sounds like a cheap one.
4. The front camera protrait selfie are not working( it's normal selfie without Bokeh effect) it's been reported in every review of iqoo z3 of youtube tech channels.
I experienced as well , tried many times to get the effect

6.The Funtouch OS is optimised near to Stock android with good improvement as compare to previous versions.
7. The liquid cooling feature is there which works really well while heavy gaming and usage.
8. The most awesome part is price .

Suggestions:-

1. Iqoo can increase little bit of price by giving super amoled screen, gorilla glass protection and stereo speakers.",4.3

75,"Good phone hardware but need software improvement. Fonts of notifications and sms are too small. Bigger font option is required for whatsapp and sms. No option to increase notifications font size is annoying. IQOO must improve this in fun touch ota update.
Battery drains early compare to Realme mobiles.
No Gorilla glass protection.
Auto hide side assist bar for regular apps is not available in fun touch.
Amoled screen is missing.

76,"Iqoo z3 review by SmartphoneWorldTamil
Build - Plastic build. Compact and sturdy
5G bands - N77, N78
Display - Good colors, decent visibility in outdoors
Battery life - 6h of SoT. 1 day use for normal users
Camera - Day light good. Low-light needs improvement. Ultrawide shots in low-light suffers a lot
Performance - Sd 768G is a beast. Great performance and good for gamers no heating issue
Software - looks clean but needs several improvement. Privacy agreements and bloatware are too much.",4.3
77,"Speaker quality not so good .. loud but not so clear.
Fingerprint scanner is fast but hard the mount finger in right angle some time and causes failure.
Other things are great .. good battery life and really efficient charging with 55w charger. Camera is awesome. Small issue with potrait mode but I think it's not hardware issue but the software. Very good phone in this price range. Performance is key factor and it does the job as promised. Screen colors not bad. I used to use honor 8 pro and surprisingly I found its screen quality much better than iq00 phone. I think it's because not amoled but still it's not that bad. You get to know difference when you watch videos for long hours. Gaming experience is great ! Did fantastic job. Very smooth experience. Free backcover that you get with phone is not reliable because feels very slippery. So best you order good case to protect back camera edges.

If you are looking for good sound don't go for this otherwise a good phone.",4.3
78,"So far the performance is brilliant .
The sound quality (Music on Google drive) is awful.
Camera is nice enough & call quality is perfect.
Perfect for those who mostly care about no lagging and great call quality.
Have yet to explore a lot in this Funtouch OS but after a week of gaming and calling this is the first impression.
Invested 500/- in a smooth silicon back cover and the feel of the phone improved a LOT!",4.3

Rating 3.5/5
Over all Awesome product for the prize range.
Good camera, smooth display, awesome performance, and good UI too.
Good battery backups. SOT is about 6-7hrs.
Bottom firing speakers also good.
Faster security features, fingerprint and face unlock superb.

The major negative I have notice yet is the ram management. Even though Iqoo provide extra RAM from storage, its not worthy. When playing heavy games the ram power is low.
Camera quality also get reduced after a while of usage.

In cons we can say about the lack of amoled display. But the current lcd display performs far better and smooth than normal lcds.
Display brightness not enough in sunlight (Indoor its fine).
Few bloat wares also present which cant be removed.
The rear side of the phone could be mate finish to avoid fingerprints and slippery feel (personal opinion).",4.3
80,"Battery charging camera is good
Display as per LCD standards Good but still nowhere near amoled
Ui is smooth but has missing elements if we compare to miui or realme ui
Ask alot of permission which they should have removed even for basic apps like gallery calculator
One big letdown was AUDIO it's a single speaker and in this price range alot of phones comes with dual speakers but still quality is low as per single speaker standard
UI is ultra smooth if compared to RN10PRO or Realme 8 series even nord CE
Haptics is bad can't even say average
Build is below average to average go for colour back option as it has bit Matt finish compared to grey one
In hand feel is in between Realme 8 pro and RN10 PRO",4.3

1. Battery backup (with screen on time of 9hrs backup is 2 days)
2. Charging speed ( 10 to 100% in approx 45 mins.)
3. Processor (no lags)
4. Camera is good at this range.
5. Finger print sensor

Acceptable
1. Display at this point could have been better. Indoors not an issue.

Dislikes
1. Ram management is bad kills everything.
2. Lots of privacy permissions during initial setup
3. Carrier aggregation not there. Even a redmi 7 is clocking around 50Mbps on airtel whereas this get limited to 35 Mbps. You would see a difference of 30Mbps.
4. 5g bands only 78,77.

Verdict- i got this atound 14.5k with exchange which is great for the price point. If you could spare 30k then motorola edge 20. Its a beater.",4.3

Review :
I m Satisfied with this phone. Good performance phone in 20k . The Refreshrate was awsome.
I m using from last 3 days i m playing pub g in HDR (Ultra). it was very smooth but some little lag i noticed after playing 4 games but game play was very smooth. *worth for money*",4.3
86,"Here are the category wise review:
Camera: Okay-ish, could have been better at this price range. May be the use of Samsung sensor instead of Sony is the culprit. Hopefully s/w fixes are provided in the future to optimise quality.
Display: Smooth to use and delight to the eye. 120Hz refresh rate is the icing on the cake.
Fingerprint Reader: Embedded with the lock/unlock button and very fast & accurate.
Battery: The best part of this phone is the battery. I got 10hrs+ SoT with medium usage. But even with heavy usage you can easily get 6-7hrs of SoT.
Gaming: Haven't tried yet. Will update later.
Extended RAM: Good option but no practical usage if you are already a moderate user and do not use too many apps at the same time. Will update later on the impact during heavy gamings.
Speakers: Again Okay-ish, no Dolby access. Also in-call volume is just above average, not so loud not so low. However if you are listening to music using earphone then it's crisp and clear
Wi-fi/Network reception: Another weak point of this phone. Wifi reception is poor and inconsistent.

Verdict: Can buy this phone if you are not looking for a pro shooter. Also the issues mentioned above can be solved by s/w updates I beleive. As soon as you switch on the phone there is an update, which is a fix for camera and wifi along with system optimisation & latest security patch. But there are still room for further improvements. Hope this helps",4.3
87,"If you need a phone for light use then you should definitely consider this masterpiece.
The available 5G bands are sufficient for initial 5G services. It have all features which we need in day to day life. Though it misses amoled screen panel but current display is not that dull. If you don't want to spend extra then choose 6/128 gb varient of this as it have extended ram management.
Will recommend you to buy in sale to get more discount.",4.3
88,"I have been using it for last 5 days and here is my experience:
What i liked:
No lagging
No hanging
No heating
Very responsive and fast fingerprint scanner
Fast charging(charger is 55w but supports 50w)

Battery back up very good

What i disliked:
Camera is below average
No stereo speaker

You will have to compromise with camera if you want performance , 5G(don't fall for it only)

Overall best in this range
If you are a hardcore gamer go for Poco X3 (Camera will be further degraded but processor will be more powerful)",4.3

 Design is good but you would be having several fingerprints on the back side of you are using it without case.

Performance is the major highlight for this smartphone and you will not get a better one than this at this price range
Display is good but if it was bundled with stereo speaker it would have been great.

90,"It's a superb phone with great processor with superb cooling functionality and fast charging marathon battery inside the box.

Cons: plastic built feels average in hand, 4400mah battery is little on lower side, lot of terms and conditions to be agreed before assessing any feature in this UI this needs to be looked at, full hd but not amoled, hybrid sim slot.",4.3
92,"I'll start with key points.

DESIGN 3.5/5 - Water drop notch display looks good though it's old. Back panel getting touch marks, use silicon case given everytime.

DISPLAY - 3.5/5 If you had been using Super AMOLED then you will be disappointed but you will get used to it as it gives a adjustable 120h refresh rate and if you have used AMOLED display of samsung phones over 20K, I found no difference. This phone has a very good display if compared to those phones.

OS 2/5 - Funtouch OS is bad, I hope there are updates about it in the future, no free themes, no free wallpapers, pay extra for it.

CAMERA 4/5 - Performance of the camera is good, it will not disappoint you, gives you quality pictures.

BATTERY 5/5 - Flash charge working very nicely. I have been using DLS soccer on regular basis, giving me good back up. Loved it. Talking about BGMI, I played it on high settings, it give me zero lags and bugs, working very well, only thing it drains the battery quickly (ex. From 90% it goes down to 85% on high settings for full game played) Try to play on low settings, it won't drain much but tell you this phone can handle high settings games, performance is outstanding.

PROCESSOR 5/5 - It's a very good and a capable PROCESSOR to play heavy games. You will love it.

Additional information - you can adjust refresh rate, starting 60-90-120. It can work automatically if marked on default and will work as per your needs. Finger print, face lock works very well 5/5. Sound of phone is decent and fairly loud like I want 4/5.
I hope Iqoo gives regular updates in the future. I want you to stop asking for permission every now and then and make OS better.

OVERALL VERDICT - with coupons and bank offer this is a good phone with all around features. If your basic need is good display you have other options available, if camera, battery(Flash charge+backup) and especially for gaming? go for it.",4.3

98,"After using this for a month, I really gotta say it blew up my expectations. I wasn't expecting much from it but it's really great. U can play most games at ultra settings without any lag and at the same time also use this for ur daily activities. The camera is decent but not too great. Also the display is pretty good but it's not amoled(that's one of its cons). Also there's some bloatware here and there which is pretty annoying (but not too much of a big deal). Overall I would recommend this to someone who wants to get a phone that is decent in every specs and can also play games at max settings too.

As for its cons:-
One is its display, then it's bloatware and third is that it cannot sustain the load(gaming) for a very long time(like 4 hours) it becomes laggy but can be solved by clearing cache but it's annoying. I think this phone isn't for hardcore gamers. If someone wants this for hardcore gaming then no. U should actually look for different alternative but as a everyday phone it's pretty great",4.3

103,"I bought the on day 1 of the sale. As usual Amazon deliver was good at my place. I was not very excited to open the phone as I didn't expect too much for 20k (8GB + 256 GB variant). After couple of hours use, I was very much Oki with the phone as mobile display was not that great which was my first impression, Camera was good for outdoor photography, but indoor it is not that great. Too many permission they ask for using IQOO mobile, almost compromising all the privacy(I'm not sure other brands get every detail like name, dob, sex, address, location,Geo location, search history, logs about your usage and share it to third party outside the country!). I was set back by reading the privacy policy. I checked my Samsung privacy policy, it was not to such an extent. Coming back to the phone, I charged the phone expecting quick charge with 55W charger to my disappointment it took an hour to Full charge. The phone is good performance wise but don't know about the longevity. For 20k it looks plastic and videos doesn't play full , black area in the sides. Overall I would say all shown in specs are true but there are lot of compromises which one should know. It doesn't look premium, no amoled display for the price, in brochure it mentions wifi in all the sides of the phone but it does the same as phone with single wifi, too many bloatware(few cannot be unistalled) , bugs in the software.
Positive is the processor and 256 storage it offers. Front facing camera is good. It doesnt get heated up even after hours of playing or charging. It never hangs and spans very smooth from one app to another . If you are looking for gaming blindly go for it.",4.3

Truly Fast charging and long battery life.

Phone is fast in repsonse, screen refresh rate.

Cons:
Back panel attacts scratches, even gets scratched by the back cover!
Sound of speakers is terribly low for a smartphone with price of 20k!
Despite being a pricey phone, it is not a ""dual sim, dual Volte"" phone. So beware.
Rear Camera: Night shots are not at par, I will say below average.
Selfie camera: Same as above.
OS: Majority of themes and Wallpapers are not free.",4.3
107,"First impression was good. Felt solid but the shiny back cover made it look a bit cheap. The screen was smooth and very fluid.

The UI to begin with looks very clutterred. Far different than OnePlus UI or Nord UI.
Moreover, I found it lacked some sharpness particularly in reading text .
Also the colors lacked depth & contrast was poor.
Phone audio quality doesn't seem to be good as many people complained.
Music Audio quality is just so so & no sound enhancing like Dolby etc. provided which is surprising given that it has so much of raw processing power. I think the quality of single speaker left much to be desired.

Finger print scanner on the power button is not convenient to say the least. In display would have been better.

Camera although good but below expectations after it was hyped so much in the banner ads. Again , there is bright tinge to the pictures . It lacks optical image stabilization which is now available in similar priced phones.

Finally , it supports only two 5G bands . So I cannot use it abroad. ?
Phone seemsto be designed specifically for gamers and not general users.

Raw processing power doesn't help much if it is not helping normal day to day activities & convenience.",4.3

Design wise it brings old dot notch display but it doesn't matter a lot.

Funtouch os sometimes feel like worst than miui. As per performance it's not that heavy but as per the usage it will give you nightmares sometimes.
Good thing is all the carrier can run on 5G so setting to 5G gives good 4G speed and internet is working great too. Call quality is good.
Most people are complaining about speakers but the speakers are good as per my daily usage. It's loud and clear missing some bass but overall it produces great sounds.

115,"I have been a user of Redmi mobiles. For the first time, I have switched to the phones other than xiaomi.

This IQOO Z3 is having good camera, battery backup and speed charging thanks to 55w charging.

I have purchased it under a notion that it is having dual app and second space option like that in xiaomi's MIUI operating system in Redmi and MI smartphones. (wrong notion happened because of some wrong reviews and Q&A read by me on amazon pertaining to this iqoo z3 phone)

It is indeed having options for dual apps... But... But.. But... only for 3 apps WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram!!!!!!

Which I think is the major drawback. In xiaomi phones we will be having second space option besides dual apps.

So as an ardent user of xiaomi I was disappointed for not getting the dual app facility for all other apps since if has been a common thing to maintain two SIMS now a days.

If the vivo can develop its OS providing atleast dual app provision for all the apps like that of xiaomi... That it has some match to the expectations of current users with dual sims and dual apps...!

Expect the above major drawback, the phone is good at its price range with good camera, battery and quick battery charging of 55W... So have your pick guys!! Good luck üëç",4.3

119,"Happy part

Snapdragon 768G 5G processor performance

Display refresh rate 120hz

55W Flash charge

4G Internet connectivity which i felt better

Annoying part

IPS LCD display

Loud noisy speaker

Funtouch OS 11.1, what the H...? Lots of ADS , Sensitive permissions required for each and everything.

Hybrid sim slot placed on top. Placing SD card into the tray and pushing it back makes the SD card eject. Some problem with the design.

Return process is not so easy. Need to drain my energy a lot with Amazon customer care executive to make them understand my issue. I had a very bad experience with these kind of support.

Note: My new phone and the one which had been replaced later had a battery charge of only 28% when i unboxed it. Initially it was replaced for this reason and later on for my replaced phone, the Amazon customer care executive few who don't have proper knowledge, their behavior was rude and denied my return. So think twice when you make purchase.

Priced too high

Conclusion

You can only consider it for 5G that too 2 bands, single 5G sim support it's not dual and Snapdragon 768G processor performance, 55W Flash charge.",4.3
120,"The major drawback is battery which drains fast as it gets charged fast, hardly with net on without playing any games and surfing YouTube for 1 to 2 hrs and rest phone in idle standby mode it reamins exactly for 12 to 14 hrs that's all and sound is very less while surfing YouTube volume should be around 80 to 100% you can listen voice below 50% volume not a single word of video can be understand and rest features are good.",4.3
121,"Good attempt but old model they have upgrade there looks it z3 5g look to old, they only 5g 2 bands one n77 b78 in the year 2021 if iqoo provide 5g they should also provide 5g more brands in camera they have slidly yellow tent, macro not good much its gimic &selfie need to upgrade minimum 20 megapixel and not so good front portraits photos not so much edge dictection & they need to update back glass also, best part of this is phone qualcomm 778 they have good to gaming , rest of all things are good",4.3
122,"Display of the phone is very poor considering the price it comes at. Dynamic range is very poor, although it supports playback of hdr videos on youtube while watching it looks no better then sdr, I have also use redmi note 10 pro and Mi 10i and the dynamic range of both their display is awesome.
It doesn't supports hdr on Netflix either.
Performance of the phone is good and charging speed is excellent and the best thing about charging is that even though charging so fast it doesn't gets heated battery temperature remains at 36-37 degrees my OnePlus 8 pro goes to 41 even at 30W charging so full marks for the cooling system. Camera is not something that we don't expect a lot of performance in this price range and this ones camera is also acceptable not great, but not bad either. I would definitely go for the redmi note 10 pro instead as there is no difference in performance in day to day usage, redmi feels quite fast also and performs well, and there is advantage of Super Amoled Display and HDR it makes the experience awesome. Although note 10 pro doesn't supports 5G, I don't think I will be using 5G even if it arrives early as speed of 4g is fast enough and 5g consumes a ton of battery. But in case you really want to be future proof and want 5G phone only then you should go for Mi10i just because of the beautiful display, and the experience of Mi10i gets really enhanced with custom roms like Pixel Experience, which Iqoo might not get.",4.3

As in low condition it is very poor and and while recording the video does not focus properly and there is not setting in camera like exposure increasing brightness etc.And while charging the phone heat a lot ,I even tried my phone keeping it in a airplane mode while charging but it still gets heated.
And the spilt screen does not work properly and it pathetic ,The bluetooth has some issue while connecting to bluetooth speaker the volume gets too loud and too low sometimes.
Hope it will be fixed in next update.

There is no detailed description present in amazon as well as official website.
In official website they mentioned it as indisplay fingerprint (But in reality it is side mounted and that is failed concept)
This is LCD display no AMOLED(After purchase only i came to know)
Camera is not as good ( Because of LCD Display)
Night camera mode is just a gimmick.
As mentioned it doesn't gives you 50%of charge in19mins. It takes almost 35mins to get 50%, (Tried charging the device from 0) but backup is really good and lasts long for a normal usage
For the price of 23k We dont get Amoled, Indisplay fingerprint, Fast charging (in the name they fooled us), No Good front camera.
If it is under 20k We may consider this worth to buy.

If you planning to spend 23k spend extra 6k and go for Oneplus",4.3
152,"First of all

My advice- It's a good phone for 17499 (6+128) but certainly not the best. One more thing, 5G in India is nothing but a gimmick for now. It won't arrive any sooner than mid 2023.

Pros-
1. Delivery was on time
2. Charging speed is fast as claimed by IQOO (a little slow than their lab tests but you know why)
3. Battery backup is also good on 120 hz refresh rate for 4400 mAh battery. It gives me more than a day backup on average usage
4. 5G phone with two bands n77, n78
5. SD 768G is great and power efficient
6. Good for gaming. You can play BGMI in low graphics on extreme settings or in HDR graphics on ultra settings
7. 120 Hz refresh rate feels like butter and you will love it.
8. Display quality is good for a IPS-LCD type display
9. Side fingerprint scanner is fast

Cons-
1. Weight is on a little higher side
2. No AMOLED display which means no in-display fingerprint scanner but for 17499 you can't ask much when you already have SD 768G üòÑ
3. Backpanel is fingerprint magnet
4. Whole plastic body. A glass body would have been excellent
5. No premium feeling
6. Old water drop notch which is a deal breaker for me. A punch hole on top-left corner would have been excellent
7. Big chin on bottom and side bezels are significant
8. Built and design isn't good
9. Software experience is worst I've used. Funtouch OS 11 feels like it has been created by a kid. It's really worst. I've used MIUI, Stock Android, ColorOS, Realme UI, One UI and in my opinion Funtouch OS 11 isn't good for any phone. It may resemble stock android quite a bit but it's still far away from competing with stock android. It has too much privacy issues.
10. It doesn't have the swipe left/right feature on bottom for navigating to recently opened apps.
11. Too much bloatware, typical of BBK electronics phones (except OnePlus), which I have removed through ADB but not everyone is capable of doing that

I would have given it 4 stars if it had Super AMOLED display in it and a clean UI.

Despite its few good pros, cons weigh more for me. The experience of using a phone in this price range matters to me.

My Verdict- It deserves around 3 stars mostly because of software experience and only if you get it for 17499 (6+128) but for 19990, it's not worth more than 2 stars.

Note- I'm sorry, I haven't tested camera yet. I'll update about later once I get to test the camera.",4.3

F62 comes with quad camera with 4k recording in both side and super amoled display is awasome 6.7 inches screen and exynos 9825 well optimized processor and smoothly maintain graphics so no heating issue, with 7000mah battery.

Overall, in this price segment samsung f62 had better camera (P.S- F62 without update, if you update the phone your camera quality will be reduced by 80%)
Battery backup-good,easily lasts a day with screen on time of 7 hours+.
Charging- very slow similar to a 10w redmi charger

Pros- good processor
Good camera performance

Cons
Water droplets notch feels like too much old
No amoled
Buggy software-
No direct option to switch sim for shift the data from one sim to another
Launcher needs unnecessary permission
If you use third party Launcher accessibility features stop(like you have to give accessibility permission to launcher if you need to enable double tap lock features it stopped working after sometime) , I tried multiple launcher, every launcher have same issue. So you can not use third party launcher and you have to accept forcefully permission of inbuilt launcher.
Can't disable permission for Jovi home
Too much bloatware
Many more small bugs ,if I write bugs of software I need much more words to explain
In short worst UI

only 240fps frame rate available for slow motion

At last I will returning this phone in 1-2 days if I did not any proper software update in these 2 days.",4.3

Toomany software glitches.
Sluggish performance. 120hz refresh rate not seen in performance. Too many network issues.
Not a dual 5g phone only one slot is 5g.
Even notification bar has glitches. Without any new msg it shows msg icon. Every u try to clear u have to restart phone everytime. Poor signal reception. Call quality is poor comparing to my honor 7x and vivo v17pro. Due to single speaker u can't listen to music on loud speaker. Quality is very poor in it . Needs a large size software update.",4.3

However, with all these perks comes the freezing of the phone & then it hangs. It all started in the first week of purchase so I thought twas only a 1 time thing but it kept happening. Once we were travelling so I was using my phone for navigation since we had a 12 hrs drive & my phone's battery lasted the longest but to my disappointment the phone froze and neither we could switch it off now do anything else. I thought the phone's done but it took around 3 hrs for the phone to be switched off and back on again, prior to that it only kept displaying its logo for whole 3 hrs. Moreover, a week back due to some glitch in the phone all my contacts were gone. So not really happy with the phone. The fonts are of low quality and blurred. I was surprised that they are offering these specs in such low cost but it all comes at the cost of lagging, loosing data and what not. Too many ads that I am fed up, even on locked screen!",4.3

Very unfortunate no one is responding for this review",4.3
225,"Had to give a 1 STAR, as 0 is not an option.

- Has tons of bloatware, which can be uninstalled.
- The iQoo's software is really buggy and you cannot uninstall them.
- The 'Jovi Home' has to be enabled, as there is no option to disable it. It asks for permissions and you have to accept it. Every time, you reboot the phone, again you have to accept terms and conditions as though you are doing for the first time.

- Sound is way too low to receive calls. Same issue, even when you plug-in a headphone.

Battery:
- The phone scratchy when the battery is low.
- Once, the phone reaches less than 15% of battery, the battery indicator turns red. OK fair enough. But after than when you charge the phone to 100%, the battery is still RED.

Overall 22K went in drain. Thanks to AMAZON. Although, I asked for a return, they are yet to process it. Now even the return option is withdrawn.

Extremely disappointed by iQoo and Amazon.",4.3

3) Network problems are there.
4) You can't make changes to specific application security. Due to there OS .

Either way, I've requested a replacement and am waiting for the technician to inspect the phone.
Edit:I placed for replacement but since the delivery agent can't see the imei number on screen he refused the replacement(don't know how one expect to see imei number on a screen which doesn't work) so I'm going for refund...Never ever going to buy an iqoo phone again.",4.3

I have initially thought that I would have to shell out Rs 19000 or more for this product. But on receiving the product at the above price range I got extremely delighted.

Though I have received the product today and my usage of 4-5 hour won't reflect the product experience fully. But whatever hour phone was with me. It was a wonderful experience. Right from touch, to OS, or camera everything is phenomenal. I would recommend everyone to go for it. At the above price range it better than even Oneplus CE Nord (though it is my opinion, it can vary for others) Screen though is not Amoled but has a refresh rate of 120 Hz and the UI is extremely fantastic.

Display size is perfect but notch looks outdated, should have provided in display camera .
There's no amoled but colors are punchy , no complaints and 120 hz is very smooth and well optimised.

Speakers are pretty loud and earpiece is very loud and clear even at 50-60% volume.

Network and wifi quality is also very good.

Cameras are pretty good front n back both.
Even in night they click decent photos.

Processor is excellent and 5G ready , so that's a plus point.

Even the UI has improved a lot now , compared to previous one's this closer to stock android look is amazing and very smooth and fast, liked the vivo ui for 1st time, it's the biggest improvement.

The only con i could figure out is the outdated notch display , rest everything is perfect especially in hand feel.",4.3

Trust me, the display is excellent! Yes, every phone has some cons but it really doesn't matter. No phone can be perfect! Specs wise, this is the best phone to consider right now under 25k after Poco X3 pro. Samsung's GW3 Camera sensor is also good! These days, majority phones are delivering good cameras!

Camera - The camera is super awesome almost at par with GCam experience. Great night and daylight photography with sharp edges and color reproduction.
Processor- The processor 768G of Snapdragon is the latest one with many future updates and configurations. It is superfast in all aspects, really loved scrolling through menu, pages and screens. Playing games is great coz you can play in highest settings with zero lags.
Screen - Coming to the screen, it is very bright and feels immersive. Touch is very responsive and smooth. You will enjoy playing games and watching movies. The screen is light on eye and easy to watch.
Sensors- It has all the sensors and the finger print is lightning fast, you just touch it and it unlocks no waiting even for a single second with super accuracy.
Network - There is carrier aggregation, Calls and everything is stable and has high range for network. Data speed and hotspot works great. The screen mirroring feature is also there. The SAR value is also within limits.
Battery - Charging time is only about 55 minutes for 0-100%. The battery stays on for whole day and more with all the surfing, gaming, music, calls and videos.
Hope 5G comes soon will love to try 5G in this.

I know display is not Amoled but trust me colours of this phone are damn superb and you won't miss Amoled at all .

Snapdragon 768 name is enough it's a gaming beast no heating issue.

0 to 60% charged in 26 minutes pretty impressive .

Primary censor is good and others are decent in my opinion . Night mode is great .
Video 4K 60fps very impressive .

Speaker is Mono but sound is crisp and clear .
Overall performance is very good I'm satisfied.

Today i compared it's display with One Plus Nord 1 (Amoled) and for me Iqoo was better because of 120HZ refresh rate as i said you won't miss Amoled colours are too good.

Charging speed is just awesome
Camera is decent

Till now I am more than satisfied.",4.3
268,"Overall the device is good, this is the first handset to powered by the all new Qualcomm Snapdragon 768 5G SoC with 120Hz display under 18k budget.

Pros.
1. Viewing angles and color reproduction are amazing and can't believe it's an LCD panel
2. Can switch three different refresh rate presets including 60Hz, 90Hz, and 120Hz
3. Decent charging speed, thanks to 55 Watt charger
4. Good selfie camera

Cons.
1. Low audio output
2. Poor haptic feedback
3. Few Bloatware
4. Average rear camera performance

Will update my review after a month to list any deficiencies if noticed.",4.3

Pubg smooth+extreme little FPS drops when 2-3squads nearby, needs little more optimisation to less fps drop.

Overall UI is faster n better than any other UI, better than REDMI devices.

I prefer if u r buying under 20k beast device, then close ur eyes, don't see any review, go for it, u won't regret after buying it.

270,"Ordered this for my nephew, my main concern was pubg performance. Thankfully works butter smooth with no heating at all. Only concern is tons of pre installed app which can't be removed. Amazon delivered it within 24 hours of launch. Overall satisfactory purchase.",4.3
271,"Phones in last few years have become all about camera. Offer higher megapixel, show some night photography and you get a device for more than a laptop, 2 wheelers or even best of TVs. The madness had to stop! The sensible is here!

Pros:
1. Reputed superb quality Snapdragon processor
2. Screen response rate automatically adjusts to your usage - upto 120hz!
3. Good battery, superb quick charge & cooling ensures phone doesn't heat up - hence preserving life of the battery
4. Good customization of OS, some v handy features
5. Good placement of fingerprint sensor which is lightening fast

Cons:
Just slightly on the heavier side (comparable to most phones though). Rest will know after more usage

But overall a serious contender for even 30k phones!",4.3
272,"the phone is really good in its price range,
the camera is above average,
processor(phone) is very fast in day to day life and also gives good gaming performance,
I got 8GB 128GB variant so I had no issues in app management or ram management,
The design of cyber blue is awesome and very eye attractive,
120hz refresh rate give you scrolling experience very smooth and there is no lag shutter in my case,
OS gives you feeling of having a stock android experience,
fingerPrint and FaceUnclock is really fast and works fine.
Battery life depends on the usage, for me it gives 10-11 hours easily, I play BGMI and COD for at least 2-3 hours and then day to day apps, and still it gives this much of battery life which is really good

I'll highly recommend to buy it, you will not regret it.
at a price of 18550(after 2500/- discount from amazon), i think its one of the best phone you can get,",4.3

276,"First Thing I want to Tell You that,i got it at 16490Rs,with all bank cards offer.And here are my opinions and verdict..

Design-I have ordered Cyber blue variant 6/128gb ,and it looks very good with shiny rainbow effect.Many are complaining about fingerprint smudges at the back,but i know all consumers dont use their phone without cases.and that not be counted as a con.Because Phone Is Very very lightweighted with great weight balance, and very comfortable to hold.At this price range ,it is very awesome.

Processor - Speeeedddd ,that all i want to tell u , it is blazing fast. I got at 16.5k and i can prove u ,it is the fastest ohone in the segment except poco x3 pro,because u will get 732g,mt800u in this price with only 64 gb rom. Except poco x3 pro ,but it is very very heavy phone and with heating issues and throttled performance. I can say poco x3 pro is a bhari bharkam dabba,only for secondary uses as gaming.And Yes I am a Bgmi ppaye4,it handles best in the segment..and it is more better than 1+ nord tooo..

DISPLAY-This is something which is pros or con for someone.If You are using amoled display device then u feel the difference(not too much,works well in outdoors too).But If you are not using anoled's,it definitely feels you like amoled(bcoz it is better ips display when u customisze it ).120 HZ IS WORKING VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE,I HAVE compared Narzo 30 pro 120hz display vs iqoo ,and you will feel the real flagship like snoothness.

CAMERA-Camera is descebt,One thing really very like is its stabilisation ,best in the segment as conpared to 1+ nord,even x7 max,it is best camera under 20k,many youtuber reviewed it as average camera ,bcoz they uses flagship phones as primary but it is much better at this segment.

Battery-I used only 2 days,and it giver many impressive results like 5000mah battery,with 4400mah battery,not bother it 66w charger is in the box and device supports 55w and get quick charged in minutes.I think it takes some minutes less than 1hr to full charge 0-100%,but i know no one drop battery below 30% it means 30 min. Of charge is ebough for full charge..

MAJOR ISSUES I FACED IT IN THE DEVIC3 IS WHEN U BOOT UP FIRST TIME AND OPEN ANY APP IT NEED YOUR PERMISSION (IQOO TERMS AND POLICIES) TO WORK(all preinstalled apps,like dialer,contacts messages and even camera) IT FEELS WEIRD AND ANNOYING,BTW YOU CAN DISABLE CAMERA ,LOCATION AND PHONE PERMISSIONS IN SETTING)

SUMMING UP ALL IT IT IS THE BEST AND BEST SMARTPHONE IN THE SEGMENT,I RECOMMEND NOT TO BUY AT 19990RS WAIT FOR SALES AND SAVE MORE..
LIKE FOR MY PATIENCE...üòÇ",4.3
277,"I really liked the phone. Although it doesn't have any extra feature, however the 120Hz refresh rate plus SD 768 makes the usage experience butter smooth. Screen quality is much better than other LCDs and support 4K streaming. Speaker sound is okay, camera is decent- dont expect them outstanding. Portrait camera is however quite good. Lastly, I loved the battery- lasted 3 days after first charge with normal call and whatsapp usage. The transparent back cover is of good quality and screen protector came fixed. Phone is quite big but feels light. Overall good product, only if you prefer battery and user experience good. More than gaming, I found it good for woeking professionals.",4.3
278,"What i notice good in this phone as compared to my old poco x2.
1. Network reception was better ..
I'm able to use my phone with no problem where as poco x2 faceing lot of problems
2. Lite in weight and in hand feel is good not feel cheap in any condition.
3. Final and my reason to change poco is miui.
This funtouch os is lot better than miui its almost same as vivo ui / realme ui don't buy oneplus for this reason its good not like memeuiüòÇ
No lag or hang issue(no heating)
Optimization is done very well battery and smoothness is top notch.
Ad and boatware is available but you can unistall or if you want complite clean that also posible via adb tool.(no necessary to do i think)

Cons
1. Don't buy this for camera or display
Both are descent but not top notch.
2.only limited 5g band",4.3
279,"It's very nice mobile phone with its price range
Pros:
1. Camera parameters is very good
2. Battery is long last for a day
3. Features is cool
4. Charging it's very fast with in half an hour it's get charge from 14 to 100 percent
5. Security features is also nice
6. Every day I use use approximately 18 hrs by playing, watching movies ect. It didn't get heating
Cons
1. Display it's lcd screen but looks good if it comes in amoled it's very nice but touch works very fast
2. Sound is dts only not dolnay automs
3. Vivo has to work on advertisement block some time advertisement are irritating.

Although this mobile is awesome in this price range",4.3
280,"My experience with IQOO Z3 10+ days of heavy day to day usage with gaming, streaming, Multi-tasking & taking pictures etc.. IQOO have done a very good job that they introduce *Snapdragon 768G* processor! (Which is overclocked version of 765g). The processor is really amazing, no lag issue found by playing extreme fps in BGMi, but if you use hdr graphics its doesn't support 60 fps then, and in hotdrops it will lag then. But trust me in extreme fps you will enjoy the game more than hdr graphics.. I Have played COD at very high graphics with max frame rate, Fortnite at Epic HD graphics, genshin Impact in HIGHEST graphics! (Play Asphalt 9 with this smartphone you can see the gaming experience and graphics is far better than other smartphones except poco x3 pro which is *only best for gaming*). It has also 5g support. There are 2 bands (n77 & n78) but it doesn't support dual 5g sim standby. And in carrier aggrigation, it only have 1 band! And not stable but like others poco m3 pro/x3/x3 pro, redmi note 10 pro max , nord CE supports 2 bands and very stable! That was disappointing! But 4g network is very good like i get in my area 15-30 mbps download speed and 1.5-2+ mbps upload speed using Vi sim card. Well, yeah it is also a very good camera smartphone at this price! [ I mean you can easily compare with Mi 10i, redmi note 10 pro max, samsung f62, poco x3 pro etc cameras. There are many features and beauty modes in camera like- potrait mode ideas of pose in potrait mode, for girls there is makeup filters, Ai stickers, live photo, 4k 60fps, slow motion supports 1080p-120fps & 720p-240fps!, standard stabilization & Ultra stabilization (EIS), 10x zoom, many filters, styles, light effects etc. ] and comes with 3 primary camera 64 mp main,8 mp ultra wide and 2 mp macro. The macro camera is not at all good at this price.. quanlity of pictures are very blurry and warmth! And yeah it supports Google Camera also! The display IPS is quite veryy better than other ips displays.. which is 120hz refresh rate (you can also choose from options- 60hz, 90hz, 120hz & smart switch) and 180hz of touch sampling, for display's better enhancement you can choose screen color as ""bright"". The costcutting is here that it doesn't get AMOLED screen and sterio speakers! The speaker is decentüòê but using headset (also comes with Bluetooth 5.1 support) you can get ""deepfield audio effects"" ! The design is also quite a good looking stylish smartphone.. the sides are made of aluminium not metal and the back is not glass (for my suggestion glass back will much costly you break that glass) it comes with better polycarbonate back which is better than samsung plastic backs.. for more protection you can use carbon fibre sticker and transparent glass back cover for more good looking and safety! The battery backup is average 4500 mah ( very closed to nord CE for 7-10 minutes) but the best thing that company gives is - the charger is 67 watt but the phone supports 55 watt and charge reallllyyyyyyyyyy fast.. (remember fast charge will work using this phones usb which is 55 watt support usb). The ram management is awesommeeeee! At 6 gb/8 gb varients you can extend them up to 1 gb/ 3 gb more ram! It means 6 gb =7 gb and 8 gb = 11 gb! And UFS 2.2 storage speed! It supports 2 sim (1 hybrid & 1 nano sim) or 1 sim 1 sd card (up to 512gb). Phone is not heavy, 184 grams only. side monted fingerprint sensor which is Reallyyyyyy very fast! It also have 3.5 mm audio jack. Overall there is No Lag, Not getting heating issue (i mean the 5 layer vapour cooling is work like flagship smartphone) and yeah play every game with highest graphics! With gaming features like 4d vibration, eSports mode, Eagle Eye Enhancement etc. Some-people say the funtouch UI is not clean but for my opinion- read the privacy policy or some settings you can easily disable bloatwares! So don't just listen every problems on this device, the device is far better than nord CE and other smartphones at 20000 price! The best midrange *gaming smartphone* is- poco x3 pro BUT FOR BEST GAMING AND CAMERA AND DAILY DAY TO DAY USAGE THE IQOO Z3 LEADS! WORTH IT!‚ù§Ô∏è The carrier aggrigation and camera bugs will be better by getting a software update so don't be panic.. and don't upset about ips screen! If you compare side by side with amoled than you can see the difference is very small and the waterdrop notch is not old.. it looks really good at this! (For my option apple iphone doesn't get any notch in 1 lakh price so this 20k phone get waterdrop notch ok) So you can easily buy this smartphone without any hesitation!üôÇ my Last update as we know Vivo's sub-brand is IQOO, so don't worry about phone servicing; vivo service centre will also service the iqoo smartphones veryy soon !",4.3

Camera is great. Best in this price. Takes really great pictures among 20k phones.
Funtouch OS is not that great but manageable. Too many terms and conditions for every thing. Ads and bloat wares can be easily disabled. Just search in you tube for the same.
Battery life is great, even with 3-4 hrs PUBG gaming it runs 1.5 days and fast charging is a boon.
Gaming experience is very good for the price and the processor is very power efficient and does not heat at all even after continuous heavy gaming.
Audio quality from headphone jack is very good. But speaker should have been a little louder.

I am fully surprised because vivo service center employee saying it cant be repaired..only solution is replacement of damage item..So surprised moment...Now my phone is doing work as same before..in this

Pros -
1. It has a 768g 5g processor which makes phone a great performance packed phone.
2. It contains a 64mp AI triple camera and having a 16mp selfish camera which works very well.
3. It has 120hz touch display rate so the phone works smooth and fast as well as the combination of 768g processor and 120hz display rate makes the phone superfast.
4. The battery is of 4400 MaH but it contains a 55w superfast charger which charges the phone 100% in only 40 minutes so the battery recharges fast.
5. RAM is 8gb + 3GB so we can get 11GB RAM in this phone as the RAM is extended.
6. It also contain a liquid cooling system which prevents the phone from heating and it can be considered as a good phone for gaming.
7. It has side mounted fingerprint sensor which takes 0.2 seconds hardly to unlock the phone.
Cons -
The only con for this phone is that it does not have the super amoled display it contains LCD screen but it is also good for this phone and works well.",4.3
287,"The best hardware you can get for 20k !!
The back is plastic but it's somewhat scratch resistant so it's good
The bloatware iss very less and if you uninstall it using ADB no one can tell the difference between oxygen OS and this funtouch os .
The camera is pretty decent
Speakers are not good but I use headphones mostly all the time so not an issue for me
The performance mind-blowing, 120hz works flawlessly , the gaming mode is very good and have some very good features
Most of the time it support 4g+
The battery life and charging speed is out of the world, it could easily last for a day with casual gaming also .

Looks Good But Lacks An Identity. There's a clear lack of distinctive personality and a new gradient finish isn't going to make a huge difference. 2021 is all about affordable 5G smartphones. Every other smartphone in India, or the world, this year will be a 5G phone. And, a major chunk of these future-proof devices will be shipped by BBK Electronics, the worlds' largest phone maker from China. Notably, the tech giant offers smartphones under three major brands in India with their sub-brands operating as separate entities. These include Oppo, Vivo, and OnePlus as main brands, and Realme and iQOO now working as separate brands under Oppo and Vivo respectively.",4.3

 Received IQOO Z3 just 2days ago.
I don't know if it is the best phone in the segment as I have not used the other competitors as of this moment.
All I know is that it should definitely be one of the best in market.
I am trying to get a hand on clicking decent pictures, the Camera is genuinely superb hands down. Lot of modes you get with the Camera which as an avid ex Samsung User I feel is a big change. Low light photography is good enough. The UI is good, faced lags twice for split seconds and I feel the touch could be a little better but it is still pretty decent enough. Being an ex Samsung User I am used to Fast Touch response but IQOO Z3 doesn't disappoint either. Faced two screen freezes and was pushed out of Whatsapp once. The sound from the speakers is a little sublime but doesn't break at high volume. The apps are organised. It is great when it comes to playing games. Have not faced any heating issues. The dart charging or fast charging is probably the only downside as the 55W charger to charge 50% in 19mins is actually not true takes over an hour to fully charge. Takes over 15hours to discharge after complete charging with moderate use. The phone has a good feel in hand and is slightly larger bulky and slightly heavier so you do feel it is kind of premium.
Overall the processor is fast. UI could be fully bug free in future. Easy to set up. Speakers are good. Phone Doesn't heat. The camera is the best part of the phone. You can click high depth clear pics with full colors closest to what your eyes can see and so many modes make it a mobilegrapher's delightful.
The chassis colors are great. The black isn't matte black but rather is a glossy lead black which often gives off bluish hues under light.
With little downsides and more advantages it is definitely a phone I am sure many users would recommend.
I received an added Rs.1500 discount on the phone so for me personally it is a gem of a bargain.
It comes with a scratch proof film and a back cover too.",4.3
290,"I bought this beast in Amazon's GIF 2021 for 16.8k after exchange of an old smart phone and bank CC discount. Remember this is for 8GB RAM / 256GB Storage option. It'd have been a true flagship slayer if it additionally came with:
1. OLED display
2. Dual-SIM and dedicated micro SD slot. Right now, it has an hybrid slot.
3. 11+ 5G bands - believe it currently supports only 2.
4. An IR Blaster option (wishful?!)
5. A higher resolution and usable 3rd camera.
6. No bloatware, crappy system apps that cannot be uninstalled or disabled.

Strengths:
1. Buttery quick performance.
2. Excellent 120hz display, thought LCD. Also, has multiple refresh rate option. Simply brilliant.
3. Excellent main and 2nd wide angle camera. Supports 4k 60p videos on the main rear camera which is outstanding.
4. Decent battery performance thought rated at 4.4mAH but charges super fast with the supplied charger.

Excellent but not perfect - to sum it up!",4.3
291,"Well mobile is good if you're buying mobile for speed network it's for you carrier aggregation is very good

Camera of this phone is good but video stabilization isn't good. Charging speed is very good but battery backup is average. Main pro of this phone is SN 768 G processor. This works very well and give a good experience while using this phone. Extra features like game mode and all are also very good. Video recording of game is also very good. Captures good quality videos and sound. And some cons are - compromise in built, single speaker, and it is without amoled screen. But after all look of this phone is very good and fell good in hands.

Fingerprint or Battery good
Performance very good

Cons-
phone back side plastic
iQOO Z3 comes with a Polycarbonate body. If you look at the back panel of the Ace Black colour variant of the phone, it gives a shiny and glossy touch even though there is no glass panel present. If we look at the overall frame, it is a plastic frame.(becz, 5 layer cooling system)

IPS LCD, HDR 10+(but okey iqoo z3 display)

Sound Quality not very good(cutting price)",4.3
296,"IQOO Z3 is jist awesome. At first my first priority was amoled display and in-display fingerprint sensor but after seeing the reviews of the users and youtubers, although this device doesn't have amoled and in-display fingerprint sensor I purchased this device and I am glad that I selected this device.
It has Funtouch OS which is awesome. No lags at all. No ads. And 120 hrz refresh rate do not lag at all. There are many devices with 120 hrz display in this proce point but they all lag at some point but not this one.
Pros -
Performance - I played Pubg for total of 5 hrs with Smooth and extreme settings and for this price it was awesome. Yes frame drops were there but im this price point can't complain. And in day to day usage I can tell you THIS PHONE IS PRETTY GOOD.

Camera - Well to be honest I don't use camera so much but for me it is Superb. It can record 4K 60FPS.

UI - Funtouch OS is better than MIUI AND COLOR OS. Funtouch OS improved so much in past couple of years. Many great features with smoothness.

Cons -

Display - It is not amoled display so... Its display is not bad (don't take it wrong) but amoled display is much better than LCD displays.

No oleophobic coating - because there is no oleophobic coating display is oily everytime ( if you are not using any screen guard). If you are using a screenguard than you won't feel this.

CONCLUSION -
IF YOU WANT BEST OVERALL DEVICE WITH NO ISSUES THAN BUY THIS MONSTER. THIS IS THE BEST DEVICE IN TERMS OF OVERALL PERFORMANCE. (AND YES I KNOW SD860 IS ALSO OUT THERE BUT REMEMBER THAT DEVICE IS COMING WITH MIUI WHICH CAN LAG ANY DEVICE)",4.3
297,"i think, this is the best and fastest Android Phone I have prichased and used so far. I have been using Xiaomi Phones so far, normally, the Redmi Note Pro series. While I do not have mcuh complaint against Xiaomi phones except that they were bulky, heavier and I was not really comfortable with their Note 9 pro max and was looking to change it. This IQOO Z3 was a good deal for me, with rpice, size and weight. I still find the weight on little higher side, I would have preferred if it had weight of say 170g or so.
Its blazing fast ( for my normal Twitter/facebook posts as well as news apps readings.
I dont play games or watch Netflix on it, but occassinaly watch Youtube and those works great. I dont listen music using mobile phone speakers too. And it takes fairly good picturs on emergencies. For real photography, I always prefer Canon 5D Mark 3.",4.3

Because it doesn't come with miui, to be true, (do note funtouch os also have some wierd terms and condition from app drawer search to etc places in device, which is something of concern, this makes these chinese brand loose their trust, it better than miui as software experience is ad free but bloat ware still there, like jovi,vivo store, vivo security app etc. Iqoo if you really listening you need to change all these stop giving bloatwares or atleast option to disable it and who ask to agree terms and condition when using phone launcher etc fix these or use stock android launcher) value for money hardware-wise product/s are still offered by Xiaomi, but 'miui' is worse software experince ever, no matter which processor you get, then there are ads...... Poco make this better as ads are not there but then it lacks camera quality,period. And it still got 'miui'(they (Xiaomi) even remove support for devices to early)
Update 26/06/2021: i noticed one more con here the device 4g i think only supports 1800mhz for airtel, and due to this call breaks/drops at time indoor and also no carrier aggregation i.e. 4g+ or lte+ indoors. (Not sure issue with airtel or device voice cracking or drop is seen sometimes )

Now coming to points why buy this?
1. If you can ignore tear drop and ok with lcd display, then belive me display is quite nice with 120 hz refresh rate makes it premium (and even if you buy an amoled display under 20k you will not get AlwayOnDisplay, so it defeats the purpose)
2. If POCO f1 speaker was ok for you then this will be also fine sounds nearly same in decibels,(no stereo speaker here)
3. Camera specially the primary and selfie are outstanding in this price range and camera app is optimised perfectly, pictures are natural, hdr is actually the Usp here, and selfie are very detailed, wide angle is ok, macro- usable, lowlight primary and selfie do ok but if little lighting is there for subject hdr pulls the job nicely here( hoping future sftware update dnt mess this)
4. Fast charge 55 w is pure epic and battery backup(easy 5-6 hr sot)
5. OS is well optimsed and peform better than sd 860 with miui in poco, but gpu lacks so gaming is ok but nt as gud as sd860. Note:sd860 is rebranded 855 so its still couple of year old cpu.
6. Better package than one+ nord ce(in all specs) and note 10 pro max(camera wise), (if you can ignore few funtouch OS issues)
7. If you want call recorder that dnt announce call is getting recorded ü§£ ( India dnt require call recording announcement by law still google dialer do it and all brands put google dialer in most global varient of devices to save money on software development)

Why not to buy?
1. If you consume lots of content purely, dnt buythis get amoled display (period) plus stero speaker device.(note 10 /pro/max)
2. 5G is really a gimmik dnt tempt for only that.
3. Camera is not your priority (because it got good camera but since it got lcd screen it might look not upto the mark but trust me it is)/or want as a secondary device.
4. Pure gaming (go for x3 pro poco only if budget under 20k)
5. Funtouch os is far better than miui but still got bloatware and unnecessary system permisions.(can be removed though and permissions can be denied unlike MIUI)
6. Plastic back (doesn't feel that premium in hand) looks gud but.

UPDATE: received 1st ota update today(17 jun 2021), they gave may security patch, fixed 3rd party apps lag issue, they fixed sleep battery backup ( have to see since device was already giving quiet good battery standby backup) and camera focus issue for close subjects now able to focus even on extreme close subjects, hdr looks improved alot in low light, so far things working good. This update shows the camera hardware is very capabale, as software optimisation is actually showing diff on camera results.",4.3

About product
Good points:
Nice camera..clear images... satisfied
Night mode...amazing
Fast...very fast charging...highly satisfied
Processor.... smooth and powerful
Good light weight design... highly satisfied
Volume...clear

Below points can be considered while taking decision
1. Battery. Could have been 5000
2. Volume loud but not pleasent
3. Themes wallpapers needs to buy
4. It's user interface could have been better. Samsung M31 is better than this.

Minor difference in display..compared to Amoled display. Ok.

Overall using bank offers as well as exchange,this is great deal.

To sum up, better than other mobiles around 16/17k",4.3
303,"Mind blowing camera. Charging speed and battery backup is superb. Ui average.
Little tall but it's very handy. Touch response awesome.
Just 2 days review. Will update after few days.
Few apps are especially Google Chrome not updating. Same reported tried multiple troubleshooting steps. Waiting for their update.
Sound is average not even comparable with my 4 years old Asus zenfone 3.",4.3
304,"Let's start with the cons:

1. Plastic back so fingerprints are inevitable.
2. Display average.
3. Single speaker. Sound very low.
4. OS has many useless app (some can be deleted).
5. The scary part is the 'Useless apps' needs access to your LOCATION, CONTACTS and STORAGE which is a security risk.
6. Display is 'Teardrop' which is outdated in today's standards.
7. The camera fails to capture the Bokeh effect in portrait mode. The aperture resets itself everytime.

Pros:
1. The fingerprint issue can be avoided by the durable cover that is provided.
2. The Useless apps access can be denied. I did it for mine and everything seems to work fine as of now.
3. The phone comes with a 66W Vivo Flashcharge and a 55W USB cable Type-C.
4. Charges phone to 50% under 20-25 mins.
5. I play COD and the game runs flawlessly thanks to the processor.
6. Minimum heating. Never felt it during gaming but while charging the top portion of the phone heats up but that's fine. At least you know the phone will get full charged by 55ish minutes. In the meantime go take a break!
7. The price is reasonable.
8. If you are looking for a budget gaming phone this can do the job. And IQOO has announced 2 years of System update and 3 years of Security update.
9. Apart from the Bokeh issue it is a quite decent camera.

Verdict: If you can ignore the fingerprint, display, speaker, the useless apps, the old teardrop screen and the Bokeh issue than this is the phone to go with. If you are mainly looking for the below features for your next phone than you are at the right place.

a) Ram: 8GB+ 3GB expandable
b) Storage: 256GB
c) Charging: 66W brick; 55W Datacable; 4400mah; 55ish mins.
d) Processor

I hope this piece of info be useful while you take the final decision.",4.3

306,"Got my phone delivered just yesterday. Here is a one day review. Phone feels nice. Great camera. A little heavy but not bothersome. (Or maybe I think it's heavy because my last phone weighed practically nothing). Fingertouch sensor and facial recognition works fast and works well. The back body is not glass but appears glass. I like that, as one thing which I don't like is visible fingerprints on my phone. No heating issues. The touch is super fast. Good sensor.

Only a few bugs like while using Netflix, for an initial 1 min or so, the video hangs a little. Never faced anything like that in any of my other phones. But I am sure company will get rid of it soon. Will update.

Update:

I have been using this phone for over a week now. Charges really really fast. Good battery backup. Goes on for more than 24 hours. Great camera. Night vision clicks some really good pictures. Overall phone is nice. I have reduced the refresh rate to 60hz. Phone is big in size but doesn't feel that heavy. Initially I have 4 stars but I am satisfied with it and would mark it 4.5 if not 5.",4.3

309,"Reviewing after 25 days , Basically I just bought iQOo Z3 because of the specs they have provided. So I never used Vivo or iQOo before. This is my first time testing out. I am actually surprised with the smartphone

So let's start with pro's which I liked

1. Battery is wow. Because I did not expect to have a decent battery life. I did not face any issues. And more over charge time to 100 is less than 48 min everytime for me.
2. Performance. Small beast it is. You can run every game which most of us play like BGMI, Pubg mobile and free fire call of duty etc. I did not face any lags or stutters with high graphics settings too. And this Snapdragon 768G is really well optimised one.
3. Better call quality and signal. I used realme before Jio struggle to get network where I stay I won't find even 1 point in tower so I miss many calls. But with iQOo it's better not great or extra ordinary but still I get tower and calls which I never miss. And audio quality is super no proximity issues. Go to for calls and audio
4. Display I am ok with a better IPS LCD display than worst amoled display which most of the brands are giving right now. No issues with display it's butter smooth with 120hz refresh rate. A decent display. And I don't have issues with water drop notch.
5. Camera is decent for this price. It's better than realme which I used before. After I updated the phone even the focus issues is fixed. So camera is a decent one.
6. No ads. Lots of customisation options. Fun OS. I like it.
7. No heating issues. Really the liquid cooling is awesome. Maximum temp was 38 but it gets reduced so fast. U won't find it for a longer minute. Really super optimised.

Real cons I don't like about this smartphone

1. Phone protection. No gorilla glass. So careful. Why iQOo missed it no idea. But I am disappointed with protection.
2. Netflix doesn't have HDR as of now. Where as other smartphone does support HDR. Hope they fix with update.
3. Single speaker. It's loud but not upto stereo speakers level. And if u play games without headphones then ur audio might muffle because of u holding the phone.
4. Low light camera is worst.

Conclusion.
If you need a decent battery life and decent camera and decent performance with good call and audio quality it's a decent smartphone to buy.

But if u need more than this. Try something else. But I am 100% sure this is way better than other smartphone which has heating issues and display issues and so many ads.",4.3
310,"Price is very reasonable.
256 GB storage is not not available in most of the phone.
Screen display is good but brightness is little low.
Camera does not take clear picture of any text in close up, it become blur in the corners. Low light photo is not good. All other functions are good. Colours of camera is good.
Battery life is less after full charge, it discharges before 12 hours continous use.
Charger is excellent, it charge the phone fully within 1 hour.
Speaker is average, not louder.
Earpiece call volume is low, as compared to other phone.
Touch screen is not so smooth, sometimes sliding button does not response with one touch.",4.3
311,"Awesome phone with all required specs for user. It's been three days since I am using this and belive me , it's still 18% battery left after using music and browsing all stuffs on phone, few videos on youtube. 66w charger - one hour full charge from 31% intial day. Photos are exceptionally wonderful with superb clarity. I AM NOT A gamer , so haven't tried that. Was searching for a good phone from long time m glad I found this n bought it on launch day..",4.3
312,"I liked the 7 days no-question guarantee return policy and was thinking to return if I do not like it till then.

I bought this product for my day2day use and I found its good till today. Following are my overall evaluation during these period.

Even it is 4400mah battery it is lasting long and charging fast. I have got 66w adapter in the package which I should not. Because I know phone will accept with higher watt and only consume 55w as required.

Fun touch performance is good after getting the update.

I felt little slow sometime with finger reader. Possibly it may be due improper biometric scan configuration.
Multiple apps and games are working fine without any hitch.
Even it is not sAmoled display quality is also good.

Cons:
-----
- Gorilla glass not used
- Would be great demanding with super Amoled display and dedicated SD slot with dual sim slot
- Alexa feature not available",4.3
313,"Pros: Awesome Camera, Awesome Performance, gaming experience is really out of the box in this phone. Fast charging, I guess I only charge it for 30-40 minutes. Network Connectivity is very good and yes there is option for 5G. Build quality is very premium. Display is not too great but you will get options to select in between 60hz, 90hz and 120hz (Don't believe on those who say this option is not available, I have checked it myself in my phone)
Cons: Many options missing in the settings like disabling notification bar in lockscreen, private safe is missing, data used is not shown in notification bar (you will have to keep checking yourself). Oppo and realme phones are more privacy focused and they really work on their software too, other than the hardware.
Battery drains very fast, if you are a heavy user, just fast charging prevents this phone from becoming a landline. I guess if LED display was used in it, instead of LCD, probably could last a day on heavy usage.
Verdict: Phone is good but you will have to live with some problems as I mentioned. I just hope, Vivo fixes given problems through update.",4.3

I'm not a gamer, so no comments on it. Battery performance and charging is good. I'm getting more than 1 day battery life. Camera is good in daytime, i didn't like the beautify mode eventhough its off. Also pictures are not oversatueated. Gcam producing better images.

Problems:

Unable to lock screen via power of button as clicking it take screenshot. Same with volume down button. Mighty be software glitch, but even after couple factory reset same issue. Due to the issue unable to power of the phone.

Lot of pre installed apps, Adobe can be disabled and removed.",4.3
318,Phone is very nice. Processor is awesome but while gaming i feel some frame drops in higher graphics and the display quality is ok. I expect more at this price at least they have to offer a gorilla glass protection on screen so at least phones display will not be broken easily.,4.3
319,"Powerpact performance, average camera, 120hz with funtouch os is super smooth. Charging and battery backup is up to the mark. Problem exists in software, specially with camera software, color reproduction is very bad, specially in low light, noisy images. Also lot of concern with camera settings, it seem the device is unable to remember last settings, due to which u have to set it every time u click a photo. Heat management is awsome though. Gaming performance top notch. Camera and display is only trade off, even samsung phone in 12k range has better display than this one. If you have used amoled before u will feel the difference otherwise good to go. Build quality is good too, dropped few times with provided case,no scratch or any such. U get a 66 watt charger, although the phone supports 50w, charging time is good.",4.3

5.I am not a gamer. However, this phone is capable for.

Corn:
1.Big number of bloatware is pre-installed and most of them can't remove and ask each and every permission. evermore forcing you to sign the agreement to use that aap. It feels scary.
while phone setup time, It took more than 1 hour to cancel all this junk aap permission.
2.Funtouch OS required a lot of refinement. For example the Dark mode we can't schedule it. Redmi phone have this option and it's great.
3.Auto brightness is working but it always keeps lower brightness than required, every time I have to adjust manually
4.Single speaker and it is not even louder.

The display is a good one, I am ok with its notch.",4.3

The screen quality is good but the screen is dull
You have to keep the brightness in full to watch the videos in youtube ,prime,Netflix which is quite irritating and consume battery .
2. The fingerprint sensor is not wide ,it's thin in size ,So you have to position your finger and adjust for unlock which is quite annoying as well.
3. The speaker is decent the sound quality is not good enough sounds like a cheap one.
4. The front camera protrait selfie are not working( it's normal selfie without Bokeh effect) it's been reported in every review of iqoo z3 of youtube tech channels.

6.The Funtouch OS is optimised near to Stock android with good improvement as compare to previous versions.
7. The liquid cooling feature is there which works really well while heavy gaming and usage.

1. Iqoo can increase little bit of price by giving super amoled screen, gorilla glass protection and stereo speakers.",4.3
322,"Nice mobile, after using 19 days it was having the same speed which was said by the iqoo manufacturer. Camara is superb, processor is best in this segment. Battery life is long enough to be used. Gaming experience is quite good.

The weight is bit high as it is having 185 gm in weight and feels hard to hold the phone.

Other things are great .. good battery life and really efficient charging with 55w charger. Camera is awesome. Small issue with potrait mode but I think it's not hardware issue but the software. Very good phone in this price range. Performance is key factor and it does the job as promised. Screen colors not bad. I used to use honor 8 pro and surprisingly I found its screen quality much better than iq00 phone. I think it's because not amoled but still it's not that bad. You get to know difference when you watch videos for long hours. Gaming experience is great ! Did fantastic job. Very smooth experience. Free backcover that you get with phone is not reliable because feels very slippery. So best you order good case to protect back camera edges.

Over all Awesome product for the prize range.
Good camera, smooth display, awesome performance, and good UI too.
Good battery backups. SOT is about 6-7hrs.
Bottom firing speakers also good.
Faster security features, fingerprint and face unlock superb.

The major negative I have notice yet is the ram management. Even though Iqoo provide extra RAM from storage, its not worthy. When playing heavy games the ram power is low.
Camera quality also get reduced after a while of usage.

In cons we can say about the lack of amoled display. But the current lcd display performs far better and smooth than normal lcds.
Display brightness not enough in sunlight (Indoor its fine).
Few bloat wares also present which cant be removed.
The rear side of the phone could be mate finish to avoid fingerprints and slippery feel (personal opinion).",4.3
330,"Battery charging camera is good
Display as per LCD standards Good but still nowhere near amoled
Ui is smooth but has missing elements if we compare to miui or realme ui
Ask alot of permission which they should have removed even for basic apps like gallery calculator
One big letdown was AUDIO it's a single speaker and in this price range alot of phones comes with dual speakers but still quality is low as per single speaker standard
UI is ultra smooth if compared to RN10PRO or Realme 8 series even nord CE
Haptics is bad can't even say average
Build is below average to average go for colour back option as it has bit Matt finish compared to grey one

I m Satisfied with this phone. Good performance phone in 20k . The Refreshrate was awsome.
I m using from last 3 days i m playing pub g in HDR (Ultra). it was very smooth but some little lag i noticed after playing 4 games but game play was very smooth. *worth for money*",4.3
336,"Here are the category wise review:
Camera: Okay-ish, could have been better at this price range. May be the use of Samsung sensor instead of Sony is the culprit. Hopefully s/w fixes are provided in the future to optimise quality.
Display: Smooth to use and delight to the eye. 120Hz refresh rate is the icing on the cake.
Fingerprint Reader: Embedded with the lock/unlock button and very fast & accurate.
Battery: The best part of this phone is the battery. I got 10hrs+ SoT with medium usage. But even with heavy usage you can easily get 6-7hrs of SoT.
Gaming: Haven't tried yet. Will update later.
Extended RAM: Good option but no practical usage if you are already a moderate user and do not use too many apps at the same time. Will update later on the impact during heavy gamings.
Speakers: Again Okay-ish, no Dolby access. Also in-call volume is just above average, not so loud not so low. However if you are listening to music using earphone then it's crisp and clear
Wi-fi/Network reception: Another weak point of this phone. Wifi reception is poor and inconsistent.

Verdict: Can buy this phone if you are not looking for a pro shooter. Also the issues mentioned above can be solved by s/w updates I beleive. As soon as you switch on the phone there is an update, which is a fix for camera and wifi along with system optimisation & latest security patch. But there are still room for further improvements. Hope this helps",4.3
337,"If you need a phone for light use then you should definitely consider this masterpiece.
The available 5G bands are sufficient for initial 5G services. It have all features which we need in day to day life. Though it misses amoled screen panel but current display is not that dull. If you don't want to spend extra then choose 6/128 gb varient of this as it have extended ram management.
Will recommend you to buy in sale to get more discount.",4.3
338,"I have been using it for last 5 days and here is my experience:
What i liked:
No lagging
No hanging
No heating
Very responsive and fast fingerprint scanner
Fast charging(charger is 55w but supports 50w)
Display not Amoled but 120hz refresh rate compensates
Battery back up very good

What i disliked:
Camera is below average
No stereo speaker

You will have to compromise with camera if you want performance , 5G(don't fall for it only)

Overall best in this range
If you are a hardcore gamer go for Poco X3 (Camera will be further degraded but processor will be more powerful)",4.3
339,"Play Video
 Design is good but you would be having several fingerprints on the back side of you are using it without case.
Battery life is good but 55W is not that working, it around more than an hour to fully charge
Camera performance is good in natural lighting but lags abit in low light
Performance is the major highlight for this smartphone and you will not get a better one than this at this price range
Display is good but if it was bundled with stereo speaker it would have been great.

340,"It's a superb phone with great processor with superb cooling functionality and fast charging marathon battery inside the box. That's why no heating issues, no quickly battery draining issues are there but in the display part the addition of superamoled, extra brightness could have given this phone a more solid package for everyone. But still I would say this is a splendid item from VIVO. Thanks Amazon for quick & handy delivery.",4.3
341,"Pros: fast processor, 90 hz , 120 hz display, 55w fast charger, 64mp camera, smooth touch, android 11, good UI and light weight 187g.

Cons: plastic built feels average in hand, 4400mah battery is little on lower side, lot of terms and conditions to be agreed before assessing any feature in this UI this needs to be looked at, full hd but not amoled, hybrid sim slot.",4.3
342,"I'll start with key points.

DESIGN 3.5/5 - Water drop notch display looks good though it's old. Back panel getting touch marks, use silicon case given everytime.

DISPLAY - 3.5/5 If you had been using Super AMOLED then you will be disappointed but you will get used to it as it gives a adjustable 120h refresh rate and if you have used AMOLED display of samsung phones over 20K, I found no difference. This phone has a very good display if compared to those phones.

OS 2/5 - Funtouch OS is bad, I hope there are updates about it in the future, no free themes, no free wallpapers, pay extra for it.

CAMERA 4/5 - Performance of the camera is good, it will not disappoint you, gives you quality pictures.

BATTERY 5/5 - Flash charge working very nicely. I have been using DLS soccer on regular basis, giving me good back up. Loved it. Talking about BGMI, I played it on high settings, it give me zero lags and bugs, working very well, only thing it drains the battery quickly (ex. From 90% it goes down to 85% on high settings for full game played) Try to play on low settings, it won't drain much but tell you this phone can handle high settings games, performance is outstanding.

PROCESSOR 5/5 - It's a very good and a capable PROCESSOR to play heavy games. You will love it.

Additional information - you can adjust refresh rate, starting 60-90-120. It can work automatically if marked on default and will work as per your needs. Finger print, face lock works very well 5/5. Sound of phone is decent and fairly loud like I want 4/5.
I hope Iqoo gives regular updates in the future. I want you to stop asking for permission every now and then and make OS better.

OVERALL VERDICT - with coupons and bank offer this is a good phone with all around features. If your basic need is good display you have other options available, if camera, battery(Flash charge+backup) and especially for gaming? go for it.",4.3

348,"After using this for a month, I really gotta say it blew up my expectations. I wasn't expecting much from it but it's really great. U can play most games at ultra settings without any lag and at the same time also use this for ur daily activities. The camera is decent but not too great. Also the display is pretty good but it's not amoled(that's one of its cons). Also there's some bloatware here and there which is pretty annoying (but not too much of a big deal). Overall I would recommend this to someone who wants to get a phone that is decent in every specs and can also play games at max settings too.

As for its cons:-
One is its display, then it's bloatware and third is that it cannot sustain the load(gaming) for a very long time(like 4 hours) it becomes laggy but can be solved by clearing cache but it's annoying. I think this phone isn't for hardcore gamers. If someone wants this for hardcore gaming then no. U should actually look for different alternative but as a everyday phone it's pretty great",4.3

1- Good display and feels really smooth
2- Good battery life ...it lasts about one day with heavy to moderate usage.(including 3 hours of Pubg session)

4.Os is good feels like stock ui
5.Performance is good and is what expected from Snapdragon 768G processor
6. Good for gaming but if your hardcore gamer go for poco x3 pro in this range..
7.Charging speed is really fast.(10-100% in 44 mins)
8.Camera quality is excellent in this price range

353,"I bought the on day 1 of the sale. As usual Amazon deliver was good at my place. I was not very excited to open the phone as I didn't expect too much for 20k (8GB + 256 GB variant). After couple of hours use, I was very much Oki with the phone as mobile display was not that great which was my first impression, Camera was good for outdoor photography, but indoor it is not that great. Too many permission they ask for using IQOO mobile, almost compromising all the privacy(I'm not sure other brands get every detail like name, dob, sex, address, location,Geo location, search history, logs about your usage and share it to third party outside the country!). I was set back by reading the privacy policy. I checked my Samsung privacy policy, it was not to such an extent. Coming back to the phone, I charged the phone expecting quick charge with 55W charger to my disappointment it took an hour to Full charge. The phone is good performance wise but don't know about the longevity. For 20k it looks plastic and videos doesn't play full , black area in the sides. Overall I would say all shown in specs are true but there are lot of compromises which one should know. It doesn't look premium, no amoled display for the price, in brochure it mentions wifi in all the sides of the phone but it does the same as phone with single wifi, too many bloatware(few cannot be unistalled) , bugs in the software.
Positive is the processor and 256 storage it offers. Front facing camera is good. It doesnt get heated up even after hours of playing or charging. It never hangs and spans very smooth from one app to another . If you are looking for gaming blindly go for it.",4.3

356,"After 4 months of use, this is the review:

Pros:

For a 8/256GB configuration and 4400 mAh battery, the phone is surprisingly lightweight.

Truly Fast charging and long battery life.

Phone is fast in repsonse, screen refresh rate.

Cons:
Back panel attacts scratches, even gets scratched by the back cover!
Sound of speakers is terribly low for a smartphone with price of 20k!
Despite being a pricey phone, it is not a ""dual sim, dual Volte"" phone. So beware.
Rear Camera: Night shots are not at par, I will say below average.
Selfie camera: Same as above.
OS: Majority of themes and Wallpapers are not free.",4.3
357,"First impression was good. Felt solid but the shiny back cover made it look a bit cheap. The screen was smooth and very fluid.

The UI to begin with looks very clutterred. Far different than OnePlus UI or Nord UI.
Moreover, I found it lacked some sharpness particularly in reading text .
Also the colors lacked depth & contrast was poor.
Phone audio quality doesn't seem to be good as many people complained.
Music Audio quality is just so so & no sound enhancing like Dolby etc. provided which is surprising given that it has so much of raw processing power. I think the quality of single speaker left much to be desired.

Finger print scanner on the power button is not convenient to say the least. In display would have been better.

Camera although good but below expectations after it was hyped so much in the banner ads. Again , there is bright tinge to the pictures . It lacks optical image stabilization which is now available in similar priced phones.

Finally , it supports only two 5G bands . So I cannot use it abroad. ?
Phone seemsto be designed specifically for gamers and not general users.
To sum up:
Raw processing power doesn't help much if it is not helping normal day to day activities & convenience.",4.3

360,"The worst part about this device is it contains junks not only junks but tons of junks.
Privacy is the major issue here every time you open basic app there is lot of terms and conditions of sending data to third party servers.
Camera is decent but haven't found it extraordinary. The pictures details are good but so much color saturation, it doesn't take natural images and the macro of this device is of no use there is tons of noise in the day cam.
Performance is something where it doesn't disappoint and 66W in box charger is awesome.
Design wise it brings old dot notch display but it doesn't matter a lot.
Back is fully plastic and feels like cheap quality.
The weight balance of this phone is good.
Funtouch os sometimes feel like worst than miui. As per performance it's not that heavy but as per the usage it will give you nightmares sometimes.
Good thing is all the carrier can run on 5G so setting to 5G gives good 4G speed and internet is working great too. Call quality is good.
Most people are complaining about speakers but the speakers are good as per my daily usage. It's loud and clear missing some bass but overall it produces great sounds.
You can consider this device if you are ok with funtouch os and cheap plastic back as some compromises. Otherwise it's a great package in this price range and the hardware functionality are way awesome in this price range.",4.3
361,"The phone is very smooth and has a good quality display. The camera is very good. No issues with performance as well.

There are however some issues with pre-installed apps like Vstore , Themes and I manager which are only meant to spit ads on the users' faces and spoil the experience. Using ADB, you can disable/uninstall them and then , this phone becomes the best in this range. There is no competition.",4.3

If you buying phone for 20k. You should really explore your options. If I had a options for return without questions to ask. I would have returned it.

365,"I have been a user of Redmi mobiles. For the first time, I have switched to the phones other than xiaomi.

This IQOO Z3 is having good camera, battery backup and speed charging thanks to 55w charging.

I have purchased it under a notion that it is having dual app and second space option like that in xiaomi's MIUI operating system in Redmi and MI smartphones. (wrong notion happened because of some wrong reviews and Q&A read by me on amazon pertaining to this iqoo z3 phone)

It is indeed having options for dual apps... But... But.. But... only for 3 apps WhatsApp, Facebook and Telegram!!!!!!

Which I think is the major drawback. In xiaomi phones we will be having second space option besides dual apps.

So as an ardent user of xiaomi I was disappointed for not getting the dual app facility for all other apps since if has been a common thing to maintain two SIMS now a days.

If the vivo can develop its OS providing atleast dual app provision for all the apps like that of xiaomi... That it has some match to the expectations of current users with dual sims and dual apps...!

Expect the above major drawback, the phone is good at its price range with good camera, battery and quick battery charging of 55W... So have your pick guys!! Good luck üëç",4.3

Snapdragon 768G 5G processor performance

Display refresh rate 120hz

55W Flash charge

4G Internet connectivity which i felt better

Annoying part

IPS LCD display

Loud noisy speaker

Funtouch OS 11.1, what the H...? Lots of ADS , Sensitive permissions required for each and everything.

Hybrid sim slot placed on top. Placing SD card into the tray and pushing it back makes the SD card eject. Some problem with the design.

Return process is not so easy. Need to drain my energy a lot with Amazon customer care executive to make them understand my issue. I had a very bad experience with these kind of support.

Note: My new phone and the one which had been replaced later had a battery charge of only 28% when i unboxed it. Initially it was replaced for this reason and later on for my replaced phone, the Amazon customer care executive few who don't have proper knowledge, their behavior was rude and denied my return. So think twice when you make purchase.

Priced too high

You can only consider it for 5G that too 2 bands, single 5G sim support it's not dual and Snapdragon 768G processor performance, 55W Flash charge.",4.3

Dynamic range is very poor, although it supports playback of hdr videos on youtube while watching it looks no better then sdr, I have also use redmi note 10 pro and Mi 10i and the dynamic range of both their display is awesome.
It doesn't supports hdr on Netflix either.
Performance of the phone is good and charging speed is excellent and the best thing about charging is that even though charging so fast it doesn't gets heated battery temperature remains at 36-37 degrees my OnePlus 8 pro goes to 41 even at 30W charging so full marks for the cooling system. Camera is not something that we don't expect a lot of performance in this price range and this ones camera is also acceptable not great, but not bad either. I would definitely go for the redmi note 10 pro instead as there is no difference in performance in day to day usage, redmi feels quite fast also and performs well, and there is advantage of Super Amoled Display and HDR it makes the experience awesome. Although note 10 pro doesn't supports 5G, I don't think I will be using 5G even if it arrives early as speed of 4g is fast enough and 5g consumes a ton of battery. But in case you really want to be future proof and want 5G phone only then you should go for Mi10i just because of the beautiful display, and the experience of Mi10i gets really enhanced with custom roms like Pixel Experience, which Iqoo might not get.",4.3

388,Camera is very very ordinary. My 2 year old OPPO K3 which i purchased at 13000 has a better camera than this phone. Performance wise phone is decent. Also the display of the phone is not that bright and clear and looks a bit dull. Buyers can look for other better phones in the same range.,4.3

Display is very dull,
Camera performance is ok ok not awesome or an excellent
Backside is glossy finish so it's absorbing too much finger prints
For gaming it's good
Too many advertisements...
Themes and wallpaper are not free... You will have to buy every item.. (Weird)
Charging speed is fast
Battery life is good
Not worth in this price range....",4.3
401,"Totally waste.
There is no detailed description present in amazon as well as official website.
In official website they mentioned it as indisplay fingerprint (But in reality it is side mounted and that is failed concept)
This is LCD display no AMOLED(After purchase only i came to know)
Camera is not as good ( Because of LCD Display)
Night camera mode is just a gimmick.
As mentioned it doesn't gives you 50%of charge in19mins. It takes almost 35mins to get 50%, (Tried charging the device from 0) but backup is really good and lasts long for a normal usage
For the price of 23k We dont get Amoled, Indisplay fingerprint, Fast charging (in the name they fooled us), No Good front camera.
If it is under 20k We may consider this worth to buy.

If you planning to spend 23k spend extra 6k and go for Oneplus",4.3
402,"First of all

My advice- It's a good phone for 17499 (6+128) but certainly not the best. One more thing, 5G in India is nothing but a gimmick for now. It won't arrive any sooner than mid 2023.

Pros-
1. Delivery was on time
2. Charging speed is fast as claimed by IQOO (a little slow than their lab tests but you know why)
3. Battery backup is also good on 120 hz refresh rate for 4400 mAh battery. It gives me more than a day backup on average usage
4. 5G phone with two bands n77, n78
5. SD 768G is great and power efficient
6. Good for gaming. You can play BGMI in low graphics on extreme settings or in HDR graphics on ultra settings
7. 120 Hz refresh rate feels like butter and you will love it.
8. Display quality is good for a IPS-LCD type display
9. Side fingerprint scanner is fast

Cons-
1. Weight is on a little higher side
2. No AMOLED display which means no in-display fingerprint scanner but for 17499 you can't ask much when you already have SD 768G üòÑ
3. Backpanel is fingerprint magnet
4. Whole plastic body. A glass body would have been excellent
5. No premium feeling
6. Old water drop notch which is a deal breaker for me. A punch hole on top-left corner would have been excellent
7. Big chin on bottom and side bezels are significant
8. Built and design isn't good
9. Software experience is worst I've used. Funtouch OS 11 feels like it has been created by a kid. It's really worst. I've used MIUI, Stock Android, ColorOS, Realme UI, One UI and in my opinion Funtouch OS 11 isn't good for any phone. It may resemble stock android quite a bit but it's still far away from competing with stock android. It has too much privacy issues.
10. It doesn't have the swipe left/right feature on bottom for navigating to recently opened apps.
11. Too much bloatware, typical of BBK electronics phones (except OnePlus), which I have removed through ADB but not everyone is capable of doing that

I would have given it 4 stars if it had Super AMOLED display in it and a clean UI.

Despite its few good pros, cons weigh more for me. The experience of using a phone in this price range matters to me.

My Verdict- It deserves around 3 stars mostly because of software experience and only if you get it for 17499 (6+128) but for 19990, it's not worth more than 2 stars.

Note- I'm sorry, I haven't tested camera yet. I'll update about later once I get to test the camera.",4.3
403,Battery life is very poor.Not even charging fast as they have mentioned.Its not charging fast..taking time.Take this phone back or I will sue you in the court,4.3

Note:-USB cable damage on charging point without any changes.",4.3

Misses the alarm for no reason, doesn't record all calls even after ""record all calls automatically"" settings. Can't set specific ringtone for specific numbers though option is there. Can't set specific sim for calling to some specific numbers. Many more glitches here and there. Feels like I've downgraded from my earlier mobile even after spending 30-40% more money. Pathetic",4.3

I thought Budget phone for gamers. Screen was super smooth. Camera was ok. Side screen lock open is there but onscreen lock would be better .MK11 GAME lags a lot I have compared with my other vivo phone y83 and which it doesn't not lag I'm happy for the looks of the phone but dissapointed by the performance in the game",4.3

F62 comes with quad camera with 4k recording in both side and super amoled display is awasome 6.7 inches screen and exynos 9825 well optimized processor and smoothly maintain graphics so no heating issue, with 7000mah battery.

But i got the defective piece as it's screen got switched off after 4-5 hrs flof usage!

412,"Display- it's a full hd display in specs only, quality is poorer than my 4 years old redmi y2 hd+ display.
Camera-back camera is good not best, no software optimization, lights are reflecting very much
Front camera is the poorest, I had samsung j7 2016 model having 5MP camera and trust me iqoo's 16MP is quite noticeably poorer than it.
Overall, in this price segment samsung f62 had better camera (P.S- F62 without update, if you update the phone your camera quality will be reduced by 80%)
Battery backup-good,easily lasts a day with screen on time of 7 hours+.
Charging- very slow similar to a 10w redmi charger
Connectivity-little bit faster, not faster than 5 year old redmi y2
UI- requires permissions in every aspect, even while setting a wallpaper
Gaming- display is dull and lack of sharpness, processor is also not optimised good for gaming, so not a gaming phone
Call quality-good enough
Speaker-mono bt loud and clear",4.3

Launcher needs unnecessary permission
If you use third party Launcher accessibility features stop(like you have to give accessibility permission to launcher if you need to enable double tap lock features it stopped working after sometime) , I tried multiple launcher, every launcher have same issue. So you can not use third party launcher and you have to accept forcefully permission of inbuilt launcher.
Can't disable permission for Jovi home

475,"Had to give a 1 STAR, as 0 is not an option.

- Has tons of bloatware, which can be uninstalled.
- The iQoo's software is really buggy and you cannot uninstall them.
- The 'Jovi Home' has to be enabled, as there is no option to disable it. It asks for permissions and you have to accept it. Every time, you reboot the phone, again you have to accept terms and conditions as though you are doing for the first time.

- Sound is way too low to receive calls. Same issue, even when you plug-in a headphone.

Battery:
- The phone scratchy when the battery is low.
- Once, the phone reaches less than 15% of battery, the battery indicator turns red. OK fair enough. But after than when you charge the phone to 100%, the battery is still RED.

Overall 22K went in drain. Thanks to AMAZON. Although, I asked for a return, they are yet to process it. Now even the return option is withdrawn.

Extremely disappointed by iQoo and Amazon.",4.3

In this budget range 65 inches tv with the wonderful features...really awesome.

I am not sure whether it is really issue..the TV is little hot (not too much)...hope the other company 65 inch TVs also having similar heat releasing nature from the below backside.If any one knows this please answer me...apart from this little thing everything is really awesome...I can suggest simply go for it..thank you all.",4.2

Sound is loud and clear, bass is lil down side but you can't expect all in this price, simply buy a sound bar that have HDMI(ARC) and enjoy as Dolby Atmos is passed by TV through HDMI(ARC) PORT

Bringhtness is too much for me..and even in bright room it's very bringht
Bezel is not too much but still 1.5 cms you can say

SOFTWARE may lag in start, but you have to wait for it to settle , update apps and let it lil settle in TV, also your INTERNET CONNECTION can me it lil slow not TV'S issues in this ,
Patchwall is well optimized then before now. I own 55inch mi and 50inch mi too , so I know

Dual band wifi works charm ,

All total I can say.. you can't expect SONY BRAVIA EXPERIENCE from budget TV segment like redmi , still they tried to pack all that they can give best

Previously I had a 22 Inch FHD Samsung LCD TV, which was working with MI Stick. So it is an upgrade for me to a Bigger screen. The TV delivered on the scheduled delivery date and I booked for Installation at night. I gave an option to use Swivel Type Wall mount which will cost 599/-. Technician came very next day noon 2 PM and they installed the TV. \

TV was not coming out of AndroidTV Black screen for the first time boot. Even after restart it was not resolving. Technician entered into the Bios and did Wipe Param and Cache Partition. This resolved the issue. Those who are complaining about first boot up, this will help. After that there is no issue in booting [7 days passed]. They charged only for the Wall mount. No extra charges.

I am using Fiber connection with 30MBPS speed and it is enough for streaming without any issues. Sound effects are also very good. Brightness was too much, I adjusted it in device settings.

A TV with 1 star rating consumes very less energy only. Do not compare it with the other appliances like Refrigerator, AC etc. I don't think it is a Con. It clearly says in the description that Wattage is 50W.

Overall experience is good till now. For 10,999/- it is a very good deal.",4.2

519,Best tv in price,4.2
520,"I got a great deal on this TV. Purchased for 27k, at this price for a 50 inch TV I can't complain.
Coming to the pros and cons.
Pros:
1. Excellent picture quality.
2. Streams HDR, 4k and dolby vision content with no issues.
3. Motion smooth feature works great, one needs to calibrate it as per the content.
4. All ports and connectivity features available.
5. Sound is loud and clear with some catch, will explain in cons.
6. Android 10 out of the box.
7. Price is truly value for money.
Cons:
1. When you try the preset sound profiles, you don't get clear sound in few content and it's weird. For some videos sound will be amazing but for some videos and content it is not clear. Sometimes we don't hear the vocals clearly. But, when you use the custom sound profile and set it optimally you will be able to minimize the sound issue. For the long run one should buy a sound bar (just a suggestion, depends on personal preference).

So far after using it for 2+ months I am happy and satisfied with the experience.
It came out to be a good buy for me.
As always Kudos to amazon for delivering the product before expected time. But the gap between the order date and delivery date was almost 2 weeks. That could have been better. At the end no complaints as I got a good product.
Thanks!!

Editing the review after 3 months usage:
The sound issue is gone after a software update. Now the sound is loud, crisp and clear.
But now the TV's price is also gone way higher than earlier. Consider this a good option as other brands are also offering value for money in this price range.

523,"1) Ive purchased this Redmi Full HD 43inch smart TV in Amazon Great Indian Festival at Price: 22499/-(after discount)

2) Sound of this TV is superb loud and clear. You no need to purchase separate sound bar.

3) Video is best in class crisp and clear even some SD TV channels via cable set top box feels like we're watching HD channel.( I used HDMI CABLE FROM MY CABLE SET TOP BOX TO THIS TVs HDMI port and both HDMI ports are working fine.) Con if you use RCA audio video cable then your Audio video quality degrads so you need good set top box with HDMI PORT in it.

4) Now for YouTube, Netflix and other OTT apps works likes charm. Video is crisp and clear full hd and Sound is as loud as f* and clear you'll enjoy it for sure. Full HD no lags or freezing issue. Thanks to Dual band WiFi this Tv has.

5) I didn't like is what storage it offers because its too low only 3.2gb i got it shows some 4.2gb. But you've options to connect PD, HDD, external storage device via 2 USB ports.

6) Now appearance of this TV is Impressive not too bulky not too thin bezels it stands firm onits stand will wall mount it later on also rear side is clean and sorted no problem to jack in and jack out of cables. (Wall mount kit need to purchase separate for ‚Çπ499/- + installation charges you can select while booking)

7) Conclusion: Recommended for Purchase. Thanks to Amazon, Redmi and delivering Team for this wonderful product and delivering safe to my Home on selected date and time slot.",4.2

 My first preference was VU Action Cinema or Hisense Tornado, but there's no discount on both TV even on prime day, but at same there's good discounts in Redmi tv from Amazon coupon, 10% instant discount and additional discount for EMI hence I went for Best Budget Fully loaded 4k 65"" Android TV. It's been 10days so far working flawlessly.

Installation done within hour of delivery. Paid ‚Çπ500 for wall mount.

As you'll can see in video, there's a 30sec delay at start up which is normal in any android TV (+/-).

Though performance of tv is good, but the built quality is not up to the mark. Plastic at back of tv and remote is very cheap. And the remotebis not soft sometimes you have to click twice. (I suggest to install Xiaomi tv remote app for smoother control).

HDMI/USB in put access quite okay no need to struggle that much for plugin as it's situated bottom left of the and TV sounds quality is good and loud no need of soundbar or Home theater unless someone is eager to get extra feeling.

In my observation this TV has a VA channel, as I've to make my living room dark by covering the curtain at windows to get the best performance of the panel (Xiaomi has not disclosed about the type of panel).

Otherwise the delivery was good, came on time slot which requested.",4.2

 I have used many Xiaomi devices in the past. There are few software bugs almost all the time. But still they all served the purpose in my budget. This is an amazing TV with IPS display. So viewing angle is superb and no color distortion while moving around the tv. I never prefer tv speaker to experience sound but sound quality is better than my previous Sony KLV 32 inch. There are android OS bug which exists in any android 10 tv. Like wifi disconnects in stand by mode and you need to turn it off and on again after resuming tv. Using a zebronics dolby digital plus bar (ARC) and the output is amazing. I bought it at 27k (50 inch) while in offer.

 I've been using the Redmi X50 for 2 weeks and my experience is ""Mind Blowing""
I've watched all types of contents like HDR 10+, Dolby Vision, HDR, 4K, 2K, 1080p, HD and SD DTH Channels, Sports and PC Gaming and its proven to be the best for the price I paid (‚Çπ33K)

The colours do really pop out and the blacks are too black that you wont be able to identify the edges of the screen (Watch the attached video). I don't know how many 4K demo video I watched and I can sit infront of the TV all day along. Its so immersive.

Here is my experience on different types of contents
Dolby Vision (Netflix & Disney +): Stunning 10/10
HDR 10+ (Prime Video): Awsome 10/10
4K HDR & 4K (YouTube): Jaw dropping 10/10
2K HDR & 2K (YouTube): Amazing 10/10
1080p (YouTube): Excellent 10/10
HD DTH Channels: Wonderful 9/10
SD DTH recharge: Decent 7/10 (Its the best you can get on a 50in TV)
Sports (Disney +): Fantastic 10/10, Enabling the motion smoothening really removes the motion blur of the ball.
PC Gaming (4K Forza Horizon 4 & Fifa 18): Magical 10/10; There is no latency.

Sound Quality: Great 7.5/10, Bass is low as you would expect from a TV speaker but there is good stereo effect. Its loud enough and I never had to use at 100. I also connected my 5.1 sound system through optical cable and it works fine and I used blutooth headset and there is no lag.

Another great feature to mention is the quick menu access by long pressing the patch wall button on the remote. You can easily change the Input or any other settings from any screen or app that you are on. It makes it easier for my parents to switch to DTH.

I might be exaggerating little bit since it is my fist LED TV (Old was TV Sony Bravia LCD 32in) but Redmi X50 TV just blew my mind !!!

I found some reviews saying that the panel brightness is low and Redmi has not revealed the Nits value, but I have to say the its so bright and I had to reduce the backlight to 50%",4.2

 Bluetooth Audio latency is really low.

Picture quality is ok.

Netflix's upscaled titles like Seinfeld may look horrible in this but its the fault of the upscale and not the panel.

The speakers are the only actual fault of this tv. Dialogues are really inaudible and if you adjust volume where you can hear dialogues perfectly, everything else is screaming. Atleast the bluetooth experience is good that you won't really miss the speakers. I would really suggest getting a soundbar.",4.2

9. Patch wall is very user friendly, which can scan all our OTT apps to suggest required content.

Cons :
1. Green patch appeared one or two times.. I'll be happy if it doesn't become regular affair.
2. When Bluetooth headphone is connected youtube video disappears.
3. Amazon prime videos stop playing all of a sudden.
4. Dark scenes are a pain to watch. If you watch horror movies often, don't buy this tv.
5. Youtube ""stats for nerds"" shows viewport resolution as 1080p when while playing 4k videos, which is strange.
6. Netflix movies are quite grainy, watch 'Da Vinci code' for example. The film is UHD res as per Netflix, but in reality is extremely grainy.
7. Display build quality is pathetic, to reflective. If there are kids in home, this panel definitely won't last long.
Hopefully 2nd and 3rd items in this list are software glitches and will get fixed in future updates.",4.2

 Picture quality is Amazing, The sound after the DTX update went from 0 to 100, I had to increase the volume to 50 and above to hear normal music but after update I never raised volume above 20 even watching movie at 30 is like using soundbar with bass too.

The HDMI 2.1 capable tv is displaying HDR content, accurate color reproduction. Dolby Vision, HLG supported and tested.

Various modes to set acc to condition like gaming movie etc.

Latest Android Update.

I would definitely recommend this.",4.2
535,"1) Ive purchased this Redmi Full HD 43inch smart TV in Amazon Great Indian Festival at Price: 22499/-(after discount)

2) Sound of this TV is superb loud and clear. You no need to purchase separate sound bar.

3) Video is best in class crisp and clear even some SD TV channels via cable set top box feels like we're watching HD channel.( I used HDMI CABLE FROM MY CABLE SET TOP BOX TO THIS TVs HDMI port and both HDMI ports are working fine.) Con if you use RCA audio video cable then your Audio video quality degrads so you need good set top box with HDMI PORT in it.

4) Now for YouTube, Netflix and other OTT apps works likes charm. Video is crisp and clear full hd and Sound is as loud as f* and clear you'll enjoy it for sure. Full HD no lags or freezing issue. Thanks to Dual band WiFi this Tv has.

5) I didn't like is what storage it offers because its too low only 3.2gb i got it shows some 4.2gb. But you've options to connect PD, HDD, external storage device via 2 USB ports.

6) Now appearance of this TV is Impressive not too bulky not too thin bezels it stands firm onits stand will wall mount it later on also rear side is clean and sorted no problem to jack in and jack out of cables. (Wall mount kit need to purchase separate for ‚Çπ499/- + installation charges you can select while booking)

 Tv was delivered today, so far my experience has been amazing , in sense of picture quality, audio quality (Although I am using Sony HT) but TV sound is also good and sufficient, hence Soundbar may not be required, but yes using Dolby Atmos support speakers will increase your viewing experience by 10 times

New Patchwall is amazing and very handy.
Response time of tv is very less which is good

 This is a value for money product. 65 inch TV.

Picture Quality: 4 Stars
Upscaling feature is not available so normal DTH channels looks bad.
Upscaling feature is expensive so it will only available in above 1 lakh price TVs.
1080P video looks good and 4K video looks awesome.
But standard DTH looks worst.
But TV looks awesome on wall mount feels like you are in cinema hall. 65 inch is so big.

Sound Quality: 3 Stars. Average TV sound. There nothing mesmerizing about it because bass is missing.

Important notes:
For movies, just turn off the reality flow as it converts 24FPS movie into the 60FPS movie.
And movies are not supposed to watch in 60FPS.
Use reality flow feature only for vlogs, sports videos and games.",4.2

 I bought the TV for Rs 12211 on 3rd October 21 with coupon discount which I personally believe is a good deal. TV was delivered on 13 October safely. I registered for installation using toll free number on Amazon product page.

Registration was smooth and the installation guy showed up next day morning on time. He was very patient and handled the installation very well.
I chose adjustable wall mount which costs Rs. 600. This allows you to pull or push the TV front and back according to requirements which is good. While booting the TV for the first time, the installation guy mentioned that u should not connect to internet or log into mi account. So the booting went smoothly. I connected SD set top box to tv via Amazon basic HDMI cable.

The picture & sound quality are excellent via SD SET TOP box cable tv.

WiFi connection via my jiofi modem was smooth and I have no WiFi connection issues. Streaming in YouTube and Amazon primevideo are excellent without any hiccups. Live streaming cricket via hotstar is also superb

The only drawback is when streaming movies via internet in prime video, the dialogue clarity is not good & the volume is so loud for bgm.

The picture quality while watching 720p which is the maximum resolution of the TV is mind blowingly superb.

One star ‚≠ê energy rating is OK I guess. I own a 43"" samsung Full HD tv 2020 model which has 2 üåü energy rating. The Sony 32 inch WD830 TV HAS 2 STAR üåü Rating which costs Rs 32000. So in comparison this TV is ok for its pricing I guess.

CONCLUSION: If you have a old dumb tv around 24 "" inch , I recommend u upgrade to REDMI 32""inch model. You will definitely see what u have been missing by holding onto the old dumb tv.",4.2

The TV connects to ALEXA.
I have loaded so many apps like sony, plex, lionsgate, dreamy, voot, MX player, disney, zee5, asphalt 8 etc. etc. I have not seen any issues or lags.
YES, white lines people are talking about are there when TV is seen without colours( simple grey or white background) but they exist on my LG IPS panel 4k 55 inch tv also, which I bought for 1.4 lacs. I guess all machines have some or the other issue. I am not bothered.

 Just 4 days back I bought this redmi x50 at heavy discounts from Amazon. 3000 rs discount plus 8000 exchange value for my old 32inch tv plus 10% bank discount. I got it in 19,500 rs only. A great discount. In 2 days only amazon sold 48000 redmi x50 TVs.Now I find this 50 inch tv best all over. Sound quality is the best and very loud. Picture oh my god one of the best I had ever seen.
This tv is best in its segment. No use of buying lower or very higher grade televisions. Even at flipkart I couldn't find any good 50 inch tv sets at heavy discounts rather I found many bogus chinese tv companies selling TVs at flipkart. One thing that customer care service provided is very very poor by shaowmi",4.2

Comparing with any other brands like samsung or sony is of no use as there is clear difference in pricing of these TVs. What this tv is providing at this pricepoint is - best in class features and quality. Also u have optional xiaomi extended warranty .

Pros - picture quality, sound, ok for light to moderate gaming
cons- remote quality can be improved, tv plastic quality is also ok

Got faulty piece initially. But Thanks to Amazon they provided replacement quickly.
Pros:

2. Sound 30W speakers truly amazing.
3. Easy to configure WiFi and easy to Install any APP (no need of any third party stick)
4. 4k Quality pitures / videos are giving truly amazing experience. Must watch and worth. If you don't know what it is, go to YouTube App on TV and search for 4K Videos. See few nature videos. You will see clear difference between HD videos and 4K videos. 8K Videos are also displayed superbly.
5. Watching Movie is good experience. There are multiple display options, Standard / Vivid / Movie / etc. Best mode is Vivid.
6. Initial setup was set to 50% brightness. But it is adjustable, so not a big deal. Sharpness and Brightness really adds picture clarity.
7. Last but not least. Redmi provided excellent Value for Money product. Just in 33K. Excellent latest android 10 TV.

Cons:
Not yet. If found I will update this section later.
But if they could give control to configure and test Dolby Atmos sound would be helpful. It is just Sound configuration you have. So you don't know what Dolby is. But speakers are powerful than any other TV for sure.

 TV is value for money , sound quality and even HD panel is also excellent. I don't know how people having installation issue ( Amazon reviewers but for me , i didn't face any issue, installation has been done with in 24h).

- The package box was quite hard ( safe) in comparison to Nokia and Realme tvs
- LAN & WIFI ( dual band ) both are working fine no buffering.
- the processor and android 11 works good together no lagging or hanging issue.
- kids mode is good.
- screen cast is also working fine.
- Sound Quality is also good.
- video quality is also good.

The only disadvantage is they will not provide Small bettries for TV Remote and it's having 1 Star electric rating.

*Vivid mode exaggerate the saturation and brightness. Not suitable for all videos..
We have to adjust each time the picture to accordingly to get a better viewing experince.
*Display is good.. but Not at the level of a premium tv.
*TV stands are not so sturdy structure. Its shaking and swinging.
*Remote have very less keys. It may confuses. No special button for Youtube and TV. We have to manually select TV channels from Mi home. It may confuse and difficult for old people.

555,"Hi,
My purchase was triggered by the fact that my son's toy gun bullet permanently damaged the panel of my VU Pixelight 65 4k which was just an year old. Inspite of being a very happy vu customer, i moved to redmi for a couple of reasons like the VU customer care didnt move an inch for my request for a panel purchase and it was just discarded after a couple of mailers. Second, i was carried away by the features highlighted in Redmi. Seriously, i feel the VU was way better in picture clarity as well as the sound quality. Donno if my personal settings is the problem but been thinking could have thought about other options before blindly purchasing.",4.2
556,"Got my Redmi x50 delivered. Here are my first impressions after 1 day of usage.

Pros
1.) Upscaler is great. TV upscales the basic 720p and 1080p content really well and it's no less than Sony x-reality chipset. Even my old PS3 looks great on this TV. Also tested Base PS4 and it looks gorgeous. Ensure you enable HDMI 2.1 so u can enjoy HDR on consoles.
2.) Os is lag free and setup was fast
3.) MEMC is not in a separate chip but is software based but it's good for sport content or documentary videos. Don't use it for movies though as it gives a soap opera effect. Also don't use it when gaming as it will make your games stutter and lag.
4.) TV switches to game mod when you put a console and it reduces input lag.
5.) Display quality is great for the price. Company does not mention it but Brightness is around 250-300 nits and it's bright enough.
6.) Sound quality is good enough for a bedroom. If you want to put it in a a huge hall. U will need a soundbar
7.) Extended warranty of 1yr can be purchased for just 999 extra.

Cons
1.) U can't adjust brightness contrast etc while using TV as there are no buttons in remote to do that. You need to come back to patchwall screen and then adjust TV settings through android settings. It's a huge problem and because of this color calibrating this TV is a huge pain.
2.) Customer care has been a pain trying to facilitate installation. I had to escalate and raise complaint and then too they had no idea when engineer will come for installation. Finally installed it myself. Engineer came later and took pictures of installation to register my warranty. If you install it. Make sure to take full video of unboxing and installation.
3.)HDR leaves a lot to be desired. If you have seen real HDr displays then u know how HDR separates the dark and light areas. This screen does not do that really well. So don't expect too much from this. But I guess it's why it's cheap.

Overall for this price range it is a great buy. If you can spend more, go for Samsung Crystal series. The customer care is much better and overall HDR quality of Samsung is better too. Though u will pay 50% more, the HDR quality is worth it.",4.2

 Pros:

561,Tv is good. Picture quality is best. Sound is little down. Little bit lag is their while browsing. Wifi single is not capturing that good. Wifi router is another room. My phone has no issues with wifi its easily get 30 to 40 mbps but redmi tv get only 8 to 12 mbps. Its good for 1080p not for 4k video so go wired now their is no issues. I invested in 20meters ethernet cable to avoid wifi issues. Best for the price. Don't expect higher contarast levels and deep blacks.

562,"This is my second LED TV first one 32"" HD ready from Sony. Iam looking for a bigger size TV. I searched almost each and every brand 50"" TV. Sony TV are very much costly. LG and Samsung are not far behind Sony. In the great Indian sale I come to known about Redmi X50 LED TV. When I looked at the discount and offers on this TV I made my mind to purchase this TV. When I looked at the features it has got all the latest features a Modern LED should have. Amazon delivery was very fast for the prime members. I got the TV three days before the shipping date. The installation of TV done by MI representative after 24 hrs of delivery. The installation person explain basic operating of TV and shows you tube videos for picture and audio quality. Initially iam impressed with the picture and sound quality of TV. But when I watched the Full HD channels from set top box, the picture quality was not like the online content it display. In the fast moving scenes the picture shakes too much. Pixelisation also there. I was very much disappointed. After changing the HDMI cable I got improvement in full HD channels but not to the level of online content. I think this is due to 4k resolution of TV which has to do upscaling for 1080p display. Here I think the TV a little bit under perform. For sound quality iam using Sony HT IV300 Home theater. TV sound also descent but Home theater gives movie watching a theatrical experience. I think this TV gives you the picture quality depends on the content we supplied to it. The sony tv has X1 processor which makes the Sony TV way costly. Overall a descent TV for the price we are paying. Hollywood movies looks very good. The low light scenes are a treat on this tv panel. The panel viewing angle are very poor if we move a little , the colour contrast drastically change. This is one backdrop of this TV. Power consumption is 140 watt also towards higher side. Sony tv excels here. Design is also good. The one of the remarkable feature of this TV is its price. You won't get this feature at this cost on other brands. Hope this TV last long and give me the satisfaction with day passes.This review is after using 14 days",4.2

Previously I used Sony Bravia 32"" non smart TV, I supposed to use mi box 4k for making it smart, picture quality of this Redmi Smart is ok you can't expect picture clarity like Sony Bravia, sound quality is too goos with Dolby atmos, with 5 Gz bandwidth connectivity is too good, awake time is so fast. Performance is good. Build quality is so good, it's ok. 4K video not supported but 1080p supported and smoothly played.
Installation provided by Amazon is very very very poor, the technician does not arrive and waste my time, atlast I contacted MI for installation and done smoothly, you have to pay extra Rs.399/- for wall mounting.
Apart from the picture, if you want the other technology then you have to pay about Rs 30000/- for sony which is 3 times price of this TV, in this price this is the best.

582,"The picture quality is really nice. Not as good as a Sony, but almost there.
The features are good. Hdr 10+, dobly vision, Hdr etc r auto activated upon playing compatible content on all apps except youtube. Youtube i assume only supports Hdr n nothing more.
Arc feature switches off my connected onkyo home theatre but surprisingly doesn't switch it on(though that feature is activated in the tv menu) along with the tv.
The tv is recommended to be watched from 8 feets distance(for full hd n 4k) which I agree is the sweet spot. My 14 feets is a little too far.

Amazon installation is a pain, the scheduled guy is yet to arrive even after 8 days. Once he did agree to come but did not have the company recommended wall stand. Instead he was carrying some other brand's slightly expensive. stand.
Installation can be taken from mi (it's complimentary) and I recommend its better that way.",4.2

Usability:- 4.5* for this, It very easy to use, but you feel some laggy-ness while using.

Value for money:- 4* because it very good TV in this price range but for full enjoyment you have to watch hd channels in hd settop box or watch in wifi network because Normal SD channels so terrible then the sb tv or dabba tv.

585,"Have been using 50 inch model. I bought it for 30k+ with discounts.

# Picture quality #
For the price, picture quality is very good. The panel is VA panel that offers very good colors and contrast. HDR works without any problem. There are only few TVs that support Dolby Vision at this price point. So that's a plus.

# Build quality #
It's a narrow bezel design. Will not complain about the quality of the plastic used for the price. Just hang it on a wall or set it up on a table, it will be fine.

# Connectivity #
Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connections work fine. Have decent number of ports including one HDMI port supporting eArc.

# Audio quality #
It is one of the weak points of the TV. It is good enough for watching news, daily soaps and sports. For watching movies where the range of highs and lows is more, an external soundbar is recommended.

# UI #
MI's patchwall interface works great. There is no lag with the interface. A good alternative to the aging Android TV UI.

# Conclusion #
It is a great value for money TV. Deeply satisfied with the purchase. There are other brands like Hisense and VU that offer similar products, but I chose this because of the better service network that MI offers.",4.2

The UI interface is pretty good. Literally user friendly just like an Android mobile. Accessibility and flexibility is top notch.

595,"I purchased Redmi X55 TV on May 2nd 2021. Delivery was as planned. Installation also done within 6 hrs from Delivery time. Initially I loved the Picture quality and not satisfied with the Audio. In the month of Sep, TV received an update then onwards Sound become Hero. Its loud and clear.

Coming to Audio, It can passthrough Dolby Atmos, Dolby Digital Plus. I can see notification on my Sony HT G700 soundbar while I play Dolby Atmos content on Netflix and Prime. I satisfied with this TV. I purchased only because it has eARC feature. It is working üí™.

Overall decent purchase

What I dislike, Videos with 720p or below content struggles a lot. Even my dish HD channel package also struggled. Aft 1st mnth I switched to OTT like Disney Hotstar SunNxt Zee5 for TV Channels and they are smooth and clear in 1080p.

When you have less budget and wanna buy a 4K Dolby Atmos TV then go for it.

Thank you Redmi",4.2

602,"1). I ordered this TV few days ago. Installation guy was not on time even though I got a specific time slot on MI portal for installation. He kept me waiting for a longer period of time thus hampering my other commitments. When he finally came, he did not have swivel (movable) wall mount stand with him even though I registered for movable stand on MI portal, clearly reflects bad coordination between installation guys and MI. Later, he demanded more money for non-movable stand, more than what is mentioned on MI portal itself, he showed me forged image of installation charges and TV stands on his phone wherein he mentioned his own charges. He kept on demanding 700 for a stand of 499.

2). When I ordered this TV on Amazon in April, there was no option to select 'MI Extended warranty' which is usually available when you order product from MI store website. Later I talked with Amazon customer care and they tole me to contact with MI itself for same.

3). It is mentioned on TV box that 'Do not open- warranty voids if box opened not in the supervision of an engineer'. Amazon and MI should clear the definition of engineer to their customers as lot of people like me gets confused that who is qualified engineer whether is it Amazon delivery person who offers product inspection while delivery or the MI installation guy who will visit later on for the product installation. This needs to be cleared in order to avoid any blame game between two parties if something goes unexpected with product while shipment and installation.",4.2

 Hi after watching all the reviews I purchased Redmi X65 Inch TV, but I have received a defective product, the TV looks normal, but it has dust all over, rust in the ports and remote is very old, finally TV didn't switch on, so I returned the TV. Sad for receiving a defective product, happy to taking back and giving my money, Amazon offered me replacement but I wanted the TV urgent so finally I purchased in a shop in my city
But I want to review the TV
TV looks good, nice picture quality, satisfied with the cost, but don't compare with Sony and samsung, their quality is different according to the cost.. Redmi TV also gives good quality, especially when playing 4k videos, Dolby Vision and HDR 10 gives good feel.. add a good sound bar to the TV, then you don't need to go to a theatre.
Picture quality is super, sound is just ok, value for money.",4.2
607,"New review after few months use-
There is a green flickering in the screen after few months use which is strange for a brand new tv and dissapointing for a brand like redmi. But what can you expect from a price like this. It will probably run a year or two at max but will not buy cheap televisions anymore I guess. If you are looking for a reliable long term use television definetely go for a better brand. This brand is just for mobile phones!
Old review-You should only buy this if you dont know much details about picture quality brightness contrast ratio and all. Well before I have used sony and samsung televisions but i wanted to have new experience with low budget tvs as well.
Cons-
Sound is average even with 30 w output. It doesnt read your mobile through data cable. Casting is very laggy that is the worst experience with this tv.
Booting is slow too.

Pros
Size of the screen is great, i loved the it looks.Good brightness, Picture quality is good if you watch content in 1080p or bluray.
Patch is fast. Decent remote controller.",4.2

 As we see above video. Problem with the product or any other feature in it. But the display is blinking while buffering a video. Struggling to play 4K Videos on YouTube with 4K resolution. 1080P is playing fine but more than that QHD, UHD videos aren't playing. Not satisfied with the picture quality. The sound quality is ok. But for a good experience on smart TVs use home theatres always.
Note:
One of two USB ports (USB 2.0) supports 32GB Storage Pendrive; the other (on the top) supports 64GB maximum. It didn't mention in the specifications sheet. eARC HDMI port version is 2.1 but the other two HDMI ports versions are not known.

Once you move to 100/110 degrees, colors are washed out and picture quality is terrible. There are not many free live channels that come bundled in. Most of it requires subscription as expected. Buy only if you watch the TV from a fair distance since if you look at it close up, you can very well see the low resolution of the TV. I'd just say that you get what you pay for.

613,"Nov 2, 2021 : Redmi 32"" tv ordered on 3rd October delivered on 7th October.
Installation done by delivery executives only no seperate technician visit from redmi or any.

User of Samsung 32"" led tv from 2013 and a oneplus y series in another room almost a year. Bought this to replace Samsung tv in hall. As a comparison this is not up to the mark with both. Wall mount was old Samsung one so no extra accessories. Bought this at 12,221 with 400 cashback. Effective price of 11821/-.

Picture quality: not good but average. Black levels are not good.

Sound quality: the worst. I can't find any dolby settings as mentioned.

Software, UI : android tv 11 with storage of 3.56gb available out of the box. Lot of lag. Switching between apps takes a time of 10-20sec. Sometimes doesn't open at all. No ota update till date as mentioned for quick settings ( ota for tv or remote idk but quick settings not working).

Google assistant: works 5/10 times.

Network: though the router is in same room reception is not good. Signal strength and speed is less. One plus tv 2 rooms away has better reception on both 2.4 & 5ghz than this. Also i placed my Samsung tv with amazon firestick 1st gen on 1st floor even that has acceptable strength on 5ghz. Utter disappointed with this.

Energy consumption: i tested with wipro smart plug and on avg tv usage of 6-8hrs per day energy consumption ranges from 0.37-0.87. But with 1hr ott content 0.97+ observed this 5-6 times. So, who are planning to purchase only for ott beware about electricity bills. This is okay for families as most of the time setup box is used. So, 1star energy rated tv in 2021 is really con but some mentioned it as not.

Display & build quality: cheap quality plastic and discoloration with just a touch on display.

Conclusion: Consider this as entry level smart tv. Under 12000 its okay (even 12k is more i think ) but above that never consider redmi & mi for 32"" atleast. On comparison i prefer oneplus y series 32"" tv which i bought at 12,500/- over this.

Nov 3, 2021 : Yesterday i wrote my comple review and today i got ota update what a coincidence üòÖ. Update description
1. Improved picture quality 2. Improved audio quality 3. Improved performance optimization

614,"I am using it from last 5 days.

Here is the review.

Display : 4/5
Not mentioned about brightness and pannel but you will never know if you will get a IPS or VA. But in home you will never feel low brightness.

Speaker: 2/5
30W inbuilt, You might get good amount of sound in DTH but as a smart tv in OTT you can't find good sound as others 20W speaker can produce.

Another note inbuilt sound speaker don't suppose Dolby audio please be aware, if you want Dolby sound then you need go for a soundbar or other external sound system.

Processor : 4/5
No lag, 2 GB ram and media tech processor works fine.

Picture quality : 3.5/5
Some improvement needed, when you see something loading and you press volume button and you see the volume area in screen also blinking like loading up down. Like this you will face lots of up down scren flickering in time of loading or refreshing.

Wifi : 4.5 /5
Both band support, no issues so far.

Bluetooth : 3/5

Sound is very low in bluetooth, no option to connect or disconnect paired devices everytime you need to add and connect. You need 100 percent volume in bluetooth on OTT.

Build quality: 3.5/5
It's plastic but we never use it mobile so it will be in wall and be untouched. Main point is in case of stand in table it move in case of fan air flow.

Power :

140W running, make sure you have signwave inverter to work continuously, in my home it's old inverter and it keep shut when power goes and i need to power again it on even in inverter on.",4.2
615,"Reviewing the product after using it for about a week now.
Pros:
1. Decent sound quality.
2. Nice picture quality and design
3. Supports multiple applications from play store and multiple connectivity options.

Cons:
1. Poor casting. You will be irritated by the lag in casting and it's almost worthless.
2. Bad connectivity : wifi will disconnect occasionally and then it's too tricky to connect with it unless you restart.
3. Too much lag in interface and patchwall.
4.high energy consumption

Overall it's a decent buy if you want to enjoy decent television experience in minimal price go for it. But if you are looking to leverage features like casting, or using android applications I would suggest going for a different brand",4.2
616,Picture quality is good. Sound quality is not up to the expectation. Even though it has dolby audio we can't hear the dialogues in the movies clearly. If you watch any English movies the sound quality is even worse. In the first day itself I obeserved some connectivity issues regarding microphone in remote and the wifi will sometimes disconnect. Switching off and on the TV fixes the microphone and wiFi connectivity issues. I think these connectivity issues are very common in most of the smart tvs. Over all best tv in low budget.,4.2
617,I already have MI 4C Pro 32inch in my House and these two have almost identical features except updated Android Version . MI 4C is working wonderfully well but this one with almost identical features seems very laggy & slow at times . I don't know whether it's the fault with my TV but its quite slow to respond . Changing one channel on Live Section of Patchwall takes around 40 section due to the lag . Once it automatically rebooted as well due to the lag . The Picture quality especially of Live Streaming seems very poor even with 200mbps connection . I am not satisfied with the product at all . I hope they'll fix it with some updates .,4.2
618,"I got this 50 inch TV for ‚Çπ28250 after discounts and card offers
The TV would be value for money if you can get it for around ‚Çπ30000 and if you don‚Äôt get a faulty one
The company has not mentioned about the panel
But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs an IPS panel providing very good viewing angles, you can consider it for a wider room as compared to other TVs in this range as they have VA panels providing better colours
Picture quality was very good
However, a green patch used to occur every now and then on the screen
I didn‚Äôt find the MEMC software to be very useful
Sound quality is not to be trusted
No where near 30 Watts speakers
You‚Äôll have to listen above 70 volume in order to get good sound
Surround sound is good
Dolby atmos is only supported via a sound bar using HDMI 2.1 arc
Patch wall UI is a big plus
Lag free UI
Another major drawback
You‚Äôll have to go to the homepage for the settings menu.
I‚Äôd have given 4 stars had it not been for the green patch on the screen
Anyway I returned the TV and got the refund for the same.",4.2

Picture Clarity - Much decent output for DTH SD Contents ,SD output looks crisp and Good.Best output at this price point. HD and 4 K looks decent not supremely Good. HDR content and dolby vision is decent enough.

Digital Audio Passthrough @ Optical and Hdmir ArC. Output was awesome in Digital audio out.
Remote : Decent and similar to MI Remote
Installation : name sake since engineer doesn't care for demo and all. Came and fixed on wall mount and switched on TV and went . Took out TV from Box and fitted and went off..

Hope this helps all in buying this TV.",4.2

They could have given a button on remote to switch between hdmi inputs as I use this more often and find it cumbersome. User interface is not very user friendly or simpler. Google voice search for any movies almost always shows on Google movies which is payable which is totally useless and doesn't show those on inatalled apps like prime video or zee or jio-cinema apps. So, voice search is more or less useless for me being a smart tv.",4.2

622,"Redmi 32in features at this price is a good deal however it is not what we come to expect in a futuristic smart TV. The picture output quality for a cable network is very poor VS a regular led TV (without smart features). Meanwhile picture quality in apps is much better.
Voice recognition has lot of issues and takes time sorting it out. Sound output is also nothing special for a TV that boosts itself of being futuristic smart.
Expected much better from Redmi. I was using a WU normal led earlier and still cannot get around the thought it had a much better video output in comparison, everytime I watch any program in this new TV",4.2
623,"what I like
1. Pricing. I got it at approx 20K
2. Light weight

What I didn‚Äôt like:

1. Picture quality on HD setup box. Over saturated colors which are not pleasant to eyes
2. Sound: The dialogues are hardly audible and if you increase the sound everything seems like it‚Äôs screaming
3. Low grade processor. The TV doesn‚Äôt feel snappy. Sometimes the TV get jitters while playing FHD movies via OTT apps
4. Casting via VLC player for FHD content is horrible as well.
5. Going back from patchwall or android tab to input tab feels laggy. I had to restart quite a few times to see the cable tv
6. Build quality is average at best. Just check by touching the bezels on touch. It will bend upon pressing gently
7. It seems there is a lot of space between screen and bezel & i think dust will enter into the panel

It‚Äôs is just Okay TV. Nothing so fab about it. My advise: Go for a 1.5 or 2 gb ram TV and with a better processor. This TV comes with cortex a35 which is the most basic and low grade processor",4.2

So you have a risk of that mount not supporting 50 inch TV. Such a cheap corner cutting by Amazon. The installation guy was in so hurry, he didn't even give any detail demo. He just drilled the cheap wall mount and hung the TV and started it and said everything else is just like smart phone. Inaksed him about flexible wall mount which is mentioned priced at 2300 in Amazon installation service page, he said that comes for 4000 and he doesn't have it.

 The TV has probably the worst black levels and viewing angles thet I've ever seen on a TV. I've been using Samsung & Sony TVs and have even watched some Micromax and TCL ones but this TV has the worst contrast ratio possible. Also, the screen is very reflective, most TVs come with an anti glare treatment of some kind but not this one! The UI & interface are very good, the remote is very responsive and there are almost no lags or stutters like the Samsung TV OS has. If you're out in the market to buy a decent TV, at least get a Samsung Crystal 4K or something from either LG or Sony as both Mi & Redmi are pure crap when it comes to picture quality. HDR10 & Dolby Vision are great but the poor black levels ruin the fun of watching dark scenes.

UPDATE:
Got the TV on 7th of June and the display started flickering within 5 days of installation. Raised a complaint, Mi took 1 week to send a technician to my place to ""inspect"" the TV. After ascertaining the issue, a replacement request was raised. Took them another 1 week to arrange a replacement TV and the new TV wouldn't even boot up. After multiple reset attempts and struggles the team finally took the replacement (dead on arrival) TV back and re-fixed the old flickery TV again telling me they will have to arrange a new TV unit again. It's been 4 days and there's been no update from Xiaomi.

To conclude:
Buy this TV only if you're short on cash. Even then I'd recommend buying a Samsung or Sony or LG 43"" TV instead of this cheap TV which over promises on features and hugely under delivers on picture quality. Oh and the optical audio output is noticeable worse than my old Samsung 40"" TV. Save yourself the headache and pain of the cheapness and buy a decent TV. Totally regretting impulse buying this TV after watching fake/paid reviews.",4.2

After 1mnth some times green colour comes for 1 second. 3 days ago automatically colour contrast increased very badly but in settings it showing normal . I requested for service but no one came checked since 3 days.,4.2
659,"Pros:
1. Very low price (I got it it in ‚Çπ22500 after Exchanging my 8 year old 22 inch TV)
2. Supports Dolby Audio and DTS Virtual. It is very useful when I stream online on Netflix or Prime. It gives Very good surround effect with my JLB 5.1 Surround Soundbad compared with my old Amazon Fire TV Stick.
3. Android 10.
4. Very good picture Quality for 4K 60FPS Video
5. Sound is good for the average living room.
6. 3 HDMI ports and 2 USB Ports are good for connecting multiple devices.
7. Portable hard disk of 5TB can be connected (I personally tested it).

Cons:
1. Motion Handling: Very bad picture quality for action scenes. Motion handling of this TV is very bad for any type of video whether it's SD, HD, FHD or UHD content.
2. 4K Upscaling: When the content is not 4K, the TV tries to upscale it to 4K and while doing it, I have observed some small flicker in the picture which is very irritating for eyes, especially when watching in a dark environment.
3. It does support the Dolby vision and HDR10+, but the panel is not capable of handling all the colors. You can easily see the visible difference in color ranges it can handle.
4. Surround sound with built-in speakers is only adding echo to sound which is not great at all.

In short, having so many advance features is a good thing, but what's the use of those features if the picture quality is very very poor.",4.2

That guy called n i shared my location and after 2 hours he is 10 km away from my location n calls me that he has reached. After realising he is far away he reschedules the slot on his own to the evening without taking my consent if i am available or not. Anyways i agreed in my mind. Thn comes a sms from amazon that he has cancelled it n i have to book another slot for instalment. üòØ what the hell. So buy it on your own risks . Better you go and visit the store check the tv n buy it. Pathetic experience .",4.2

 Redmi product (this TV) itself has an issue. All the existing products.

When we reduce the backlight to <93% and switch OFF dynamic backlight, waves appear from bottom to top when in Android mode. This is a serious issue and not sure why Redmi has not taken note of it.
Default backlight is 100%, hence you will not be able to see the issue by default. However, if 100% backlight is kept always, it will damage the TV in the long run.

PS: TV was first replaced by Amazon, but the same issue was seen in the replaced TV as well.
Amazon later accepted the 2nd return and the amount was refunded immediately without any hassle. Customer care in Amazon - one of the friendliest!! Absolutely no hassle!",4.2

 This model has a very serious issue with its picture panel. When you reduce the brightness there is no effect, and it doesn't reduce the brightness. You will have to reduce the backlight of the TV, and then screen starts to give waves like flickering as seen in the photos I've uploaded.
I replaced this item once but the second replacement had the same issue, so I returned this. I think paying about 40k for a TV and if you are getting this kind of flickering on the same day, then its a waste of money. I strongly don't recommend this product and request the manufacturer to address this issue asap.",4.2

So this time too the delivery was smooth and on schedule.
The Sony service center team did call us but I had already installed the TV by myself as it was pretty simple. Service center team came to our house and delivered the wall mount panel and also they informed that they will do free mounting . I didn't require the mounting at that time.

Finally about the product.

Display, viewing angles and Sound quality is good. But would suggest people to get a good soundbar for good cinematic experience. (always recommended for any TV).
The TV comes with smart features. It has dedicated YouTube and Netflix button on the remote. It has apps like prime, zee, yupp, Eros now, etc. I want to install Hotstar app but not sure if it is possible.
The only issue is the smart tv interface is too laggy. I guess the RAM is not sufficient enough. Other than that playback happens super smooth which depends on a good wifi connection.

So for a 43"" TV 38k is a bit high considering Chinese competitors like one plus giving at a much cheaper cost. But I paid a premium for a non Chinese company, Sony, which is also a made in India product and I have not qualms about it.

Update: one cannot install additional apps on any ""Smart TV"". It has to be an ""Android TV"" for any new application installation",4.6

The screen mirroring with phone and laptop works very smoothly. Built in apps - Netflix, Prime Videos, Youtube, Sony Liv, Zee5, Eros now, Big flix, Alt Balaji, Voot, Hungama Play.
Also, inbuilt browser and FM radio available.

 I have compared all available TVs in this category and price range. This one is the best option available in this segment, simply go for it.. If you are a fan of picture quality, then you can stop your search and buy this. it‚Äôs better than many of the cheap 4K TVs in this price range.

Sound quality is average, but it does the job for a normal size living room.. I am using a Bose sound bar and it gives awesome sound output from the HDMI ARC port. All latest sound bar can be used with this TV because it has an hdmi arc port.

Sony‚Äôs quality is always been top notch, but still built quality is not top class in this TV. Quality of plastic is average and fitment is flimsy. TV is made in India, power adapter is made in Indonesia, only the remote is China made..

There is a lag in loading i guess thats the Ram but then the internet experience is really good the buffering is nil actually until u try fast-forward or backward which still is ok and smooth. Dedicated buttons for youtube and netflix. Prime available but no hotstar. For hotstar the only way is screen mirroring (through browser.. through app the display had issues) which u know sucks..

I would like to point out 2 things though:
1. The TV doesn't support 5 GHz band. It only supports 2.4 GHz, which MIGHT cause some buffering issues while using the inbuilt OTT apps on TV. However, while testing out apps on TV (2.4 Ghz band), I did not have any issue. It might be because my Wifi router (with 300 Mbps speed) is kept right below the TV. However, you can feel the issue of slowness at 2.4 GHz, when you start using the pre-installed browser on TV to open 'Hotstar'. (Yes, Hotstar doesn't come with the TV and nor can you install the app).
I am anyways using Amazon Fire TV stick which supports 5 GHz band. If you are planning to use one too, you shouldn't worry at all.

2. It is very difficult to insert USB drives/ HDMI cables once the TV has been wall mounted. Personally, I did not like this, but most people can live with it.",4.6

The sound is the only annoying thing. If there is a power outage and TV stops in high volume mode, when its restarted, it starts with a very high volume with the snowy screen. I have another smart TV- Samsung and that starts in the silent mode. So probably, this is a slip on Sony's part or maybe there is a setting to switch the sound off when starting, which I don't know, so giving it the benefit of the doubt. Pros - light n easy to move. Netflix n YouTube buttons on the remote make for quick access. TV is quick to respond unlike my old Samsung smart TV which has a notoriously annoying lag between remote action n TV response. The sound of this TV is OK. There is no hotstar preloaded. The navigation home menu is a little confusing as compared to my Samsung. Overall, this is a great buy for the money shelled out.",4.6

2. Amazing Sound Quality. This is where SONY is at the top.

Cons :
1. Sound is low on the internet settings.The sound I am getting at 80% is equivalent to 30% on HDMI through amazon Firestick. Don't know why. I haven't tested on Cable antenna connection. I think a software update can fix this.
2. Yes, I am using firestick because this TV comes with very limited apps and that does not include Hotstar. moreover, additional apps cannot be installed.

The delivery was lightening fast as It got delivered within 12-24hrs ! The packaging was good. I had to wait for 2 more days as the installation had to be done by a Sony mechanic. The TV was in good shape, and the installation was done very fast. We already had a TV stand on which it was mounted.
I definitely noticed a change in the TV thickness; this new one was thicker than the previous one. But the mechanic assured that it is because this TV had separate Display and backlight panels, and it was a good thing as individual damage to these components can be repaired easily, unlike the previous one, where I will have to change the whole panel to correct and damage.
The screen looked nice and I had to tweak some adjustments to get the images to a level of picture quality I wanted. The sound
quality was adequate for our relatively smaller hall.
One problem I noticed was that the TV remote was not that good, as I was having problems with the home button, which is used to navigate to the preinstalled apps like amazon prime video. I had to press many times and had to press some other buttons to make it work. It had shortcut buttons for Netflix and Youtube, so those were not a problem. The connectivity seems okay for now (it was my main concern as many other budget TVs like MI TV were having connectivity issues).
This is the immediate review of the TV, and still need to spend some time for other functions. So far I think this has got value for money.",4.6

 Decent for the price. Couple of things to know before buying

Linux based , cannot load more apps like android. Hotstar is not available. Will need a firestick to watch anything other than Netflix , YouTube prime and vu . No optical fibre connection provided .

Advantages : 1. Relatively light weight and the wall mount is very compact
2. Sound is decent for a normal living space.
3. Picture quality is good. Full HD and no 4k
4. Hdmi arc and hdmi2 is available apart from aux and VGA

5. Remote is easy to use with dedicated keys for YouTube and Netflix .

I connected my JBL soundbar plus sub woofer and movies are a delight to watch.

If one can get 55"" TV at same price, you need to innovate on product.",4.6
781,"Today installation and demo is done. Tv is good.
Clarity Is top notch. Being a big fan of sony soung,a bit disappointed with sound but it's ok if you are going with a 5.1 setup. Smart features did not explore well. But wifi connectivity is good.
You even have radio option. overall a satisfied buy. Anyways it's electronics so need to handle carefully. Body seemed a bit delicate. And option for analog and power cables is at back would have been easy access if it were given on side. That's what I felt a bit inaccessible.",4.6
782,Netflix and youtube are perfectly operating... But prime is so laggy and it only responds after 5-10 secs...! But got used to that speed... And came to know that TVs would be like that..!,4.6
783,"I would say its just an average product from the house of SONY. Processing speed/response-time is rather poor.Web browser is definitely there but one has to be really patient to use it.
Sound quality is definitely an USP for the product.
In the end, given the price tag (of 32k approx) and sony brand name its just value for money. Dont expect much !!!",4.6
784,"On delivery & Installation - it was smooth and on time and just that installation we need to follow up on consistent basis to Sony/Amazon. And if we dont call them, the product would remain in the pack forever!

I had a 32 inch Sony ( bought 14 years back!) and this upgrade to 43 inch. Picture quality is amazing and excellent but somehow the depth of audio is missing. On the audio part for all the claims given in the specs, I dont see any difference at all. It is a good upgrade for me, but made to regret that I did not look beyond Sony for better audio experience..",4.6
785,"Sony Smart tv is value for money.
Picture quality 10 out 10
Sound quality 10 out 8 (need to be improve not like sony audio system)
Build quality 10 out 10

Con. I am unable to use FM without antina
Overall good at Price 34k.Thk to Amazon",4.6
786,"The TV itself amazing. The delivery was fast and also with the installation. The TV was bigger than I was expecting. The only thing I notice is when we use apps TV lags not a lot but it would be noticeable when you show off the TV with your friends. I dunno if that's how a smartv suppose to work? Its my first time... Apart from that, the TV is amazing.",4.6
787,"I got my Sony Bravia tv delivered on 11october and everything was as mentioned and good. So for the installation of my tv I reached to amazon service center the same day, the lady attenting my issues was very attentive and was helpful but the next day I got call from sony service center Kohima and I got denied for installation telling me to do by myself as they are busy and don't come for setting up the tv except for mounting in the wall. I reached to him again as I was having problem connecting my tv with my set up box but still they dint came. If such rules are there for installation than its better not to mention as I dint got any installation service. I figured out myself n did it by myself. Seriously disappointed with the service provided.",4.6
788,"This TV was a good purchase indeed. Earlier I was hesitating to buy something bigger amount thing from amazon, but Amazon has changed my view. The picture quality and the sound is good. To be very frank i have only opened YouTube few times and i liked it personally. Except YouTube i have not checked any other application.

You can buy this without any second thoughts.",4.6
789,"Recieved tv on 26th April n technician came on 27th n installed properly and he is perfect n expert explained all related to tv...but only problem wt I faced is tv did not on first then I was worried that I made mistake as it was ordered online .. finally sony technian resolved it...
I will post another review after a couple of days...",4.6
790,"I am writing review after one month of using the product. TV quality is average overall. As it is smart TV I expected it to have basic apps like hotstar but it does not have the app and there is no way of installing the app. The TV keeps disconnecting from my internet and I have to to constantly setup the internet again as well as set up the apps when this happens. This has happened thrice in a month. I tried contacting Sony customer service and they told me it is network issue but I use high speed internet and it works perfectly fine with my other devices so I am sure it is not issue with my network but the TV. Also when the person came for installation he was constantly behind me to give a 5 star rating. when I told him I will do so later after using the product, he kept calling me for 2-3 days and insisting that I should give rating and email the screenshot to him I think that is why this TV has a higher rating because they get behind customers to give them a good rating but it is a very average as per what I have used it till now. The installation guy also told me to buy a 4K wire for connecting my TV to jio set top box which I don't think is required because if that was a requirement the company would have given a 4k wire with the TV itself. He said that there will be lines on TV in some months if I don't use the 4k wire. There has been no such case till now but if it happens it will be the worst choice of TV that I buy. I will update this review further if that happens.",4.6
791,"The delivery and installation very fast as expected.
Picture and Sound quality is very good, if you have the HD source it‚Äôs look amazing picture quality of HDR. But when we try to access the ott applications feel slow response, maybe it‚Äôs cause of ram limitations otherwise it‚Äôs over all basics functions are good in my point of view.

This model remote doesn‚Äôt support set top box programming functions.

When we insert the USB auto play on, there‚Äôs no way to choose the USB source through remote.
During the installation they‚Äôve fit small size wall mount bracket in to tv bit worried about that not sure if it will withstand.

Thanks to Amazon for fastest delivery.

Thanks to Sony support make the installation arrangements as scheduled.",4.6
792,"Major shortcomings of this TV:
-No Hotstar support
-Inbuilt apps do not support latest releases (probably don't support new media formats). Example: SonyLiv app do not play latest movies or stored/non-live content.
-In-built web-browser is useless (do not open anything in reasonable time), forget about streaming anything from browser.
-Till-now, not found anything to update the software/firmware of TV so apps can be updated.

Good points:
Clear screen and sound.

Suggestion: go with android TV",4.6
793,"just purchased this product on amazon on 10.9.2020,on installation and viewing it for some time found defect in display(minute black spot on display)on closer look,thereby causing a very bad impression of the product as well as company name who is known to provide superior product ,it a very humble suggestion,pls verify after installation whether the display/sound is proper or not.tried to call support was unable to get contacted,finally mailed the product issue on mail,hope sony support respond to complaint and resolve my issue at the earliest.",4.6
794,"Picture quality is good. But my suggestion is that do not buy this TV, because only few apps like YouTube, amazon prime, Netflix, etc. are there. You can't install other apps like hotstar, hoichoi,... It's not an android TV, Google play store isn't there. You can't even cast movies from other devices. Inbuilt Web browser is also pathetic not able to play most of the videos with hotstar or anything else. Totally disappointed with this product. Done lots of searching before buying this product. But missed this kind of feedback from others whoever using this device.",4.6

The TV doesn't has Google play store",4.6
796,"Honestly speaking it is costly, If your looking for the Full HD without smart feature one you can go ahead else you may need to buy streaming device Amazon fire tv stick to really make it smart or any other streaming device",4.6
797,"It does say it‚Äôs a smart TV but I would recommend going for LG or Samsung as they offer better apps and features over Sony. There is a big difference between smart and android and Sony does not know that and that‚Äôs y you cannot even download apps.
There is not hotstar for instance they only have Netflix and amazon prime and LG and Samsung give way more for the same amount of money.",4.6
798,"Play Video
 While showing demo display at good condition but wen I connected my laptop to TV through HDMI cable , some varies lines coming into the displays at varies place So spoke to installation person he said it‚Äôs depends on cable fault and set of box...
if problems comes continuously, Amazon or Sony
needs to be provide free replacement (video is attached).
Picture quality is very good.. love to watch quality movie.. Sound quality is good not bad..
it‚Äôs nice TV,,

if Bluetooth supports and if more than 2 HDMI cable had means ,, its value for money ...

OS process is very slow... apps are opening very slowly..",4.6
799,"Good display quality (colour reproduction) with ample sound output(inbuilt) for viewing pleasure.
Bezel is flimsy with sharp edges (injection mould issue). Build Quality is pretty low for the brand and price point.
Dust attraction is very less though. Hotstar unavailable in the preloaded app set is quite disappointing considering we cant view it in the browser as well which is very very slow. Does not support 5Ghz bandwidth wifi network. Self installed the device since Wall mounting was not required. Installation technician anyway visited to check and he upgraded the software to the latest version.",4.6
800,"Picture not great (compared better quality Mi is great) not believe is it sony (Wi-Fi and inbuilt apps only no host star app Also) mirror cast options there.

You want sony tv in low cost this is the options. But no return and replacement ( if not like the tv)",4.6
801,Picture and sound quality of this tv is one of the best in the market. But the os is linux based and not android. Which means we cannot install additional apps from playstore and have to use only the preinstalled apps which comes with the tv. A browser is there but it is not too handy to use. So I suggest you to think before investing 35k only for the great sound and picture quality. If sound and picture is your priority then go for it. And if specifications are your thrust options then search other options.,4.6
802,"Product delivered on time and installation was prompt and professional by ""Balaji service centre, Akota"".

But I am not happy with how Amazon has specified the product. They call it smart tv but sony does not include and also does not allow to install any other apps like hotstar.",4.6

Highly dissatisfied with the technical support.",4.6
810,"I have used the TV for one month and here is my review.
Picture quality : 2.5/5, Do not expect much because of sony brand, I would say you get same feel when compared to TCL Tv. The picture quality is good, when there is low lighting in the house even tho you increase backlight of TV.

Sound: Average 2/3 clarity will be but you have to keep minimum 50-60/100.

Internet connectivity is good. Pre-installed apps runs smoothly can't install new apps and you cannot even use them browser.

We browser is very slow even with good internet speed it takes more than 5 seconds lo load for each page

Build quality I'm not sure about interior but exterior looks like a normal cheap TV.

Overal 2.8/5",4.6
811,"Play Video
 The wall mounting provided is not standard. I'm fact the provision in the TV itself for wall mounting is not proper. TV is not vertical. It's 80 deg from horizontal(see Pic). Due to the fixture, TV doesn't rotate or slide even a centimeter. My previous TV stand (for LG 43"") Is not compatible with this TV. Previous one was very strong. Rotation was possible. TV is at risk of falling. How sony could design such an unsafe mounting.",4.6
812,I have to replace it and replacement was also defective. Although everything was smooth from Amazon site. A technician visited and confirmed that it is a defective piece. But seller has sent the defective piece again. 5 stars to amazon service and -5 to seller.,4.6

Only youtube and netflix were available, and since it doesn't have an app store no hotstar and amazon prime. Since a month even those two have disappeared, and now it's just a TV pretending to be a smart TV but with no capabilities of a smart TV. Feel like an idiot for buying it.",4.6
814,"Product is good but as per mentioned installation charges is free and wall stand also mentioned ,however 1700 rupees are extra charger from my father and he is cheated my father and mother and demanded for extra money

815,"Only limited apps are pre-installed on this TV. You cannot use Hotstar or any other app which is not installed. Opening the browser on this TV is too slow. Also due to limited internal memory, if you open any streaming website like Hotstar on a browser then the browser hangs. It is not an android TV so you cannot install apps. Also, if you open the SonyLiv app installed on TV then you cannot play any premium content as it shows this device not supported.",4.6
816,I bought this TV for my parents and we received a defective item. Had to call customer care multiple times to get it replaced. Dealing with Sony customer care for installation was another trouble. Worst experience shopping with Amazon so far. It's better to buy such items from a showroom.,4.6

Coming to the product - since it is a Whirlpool, there is no complaint whatsoever. The product is working perfectly well. I got a free installation too which is really appreciated.

Coming to the product, I stay alone and needed a fridge for my regular usage for example keeping eggs, chicken, fruit, vegetables, dairy products and any leftover food. Now, I don't use it for cooling water as I do not like to consume cold water. However, I do believe this product has enough space for a family of 2-4 people depending upon how much you want to store. Additionally, installation was simple and this product works well with normal voltage fluctuations. So far I have not had to avail after sales service but I trust them.

1. Always check the product before sharing the delivery code. Do not accept if the product is damaged or have missing accessories.

2. Do not power on the refrigerator after first installation. Wait for up to 4 hours so the compressor is in ideal condition. Then you can use it 24 x 7.

3. Level your refrigerator. There is no need for 4 foot accessories because the door level should be somewhat upper than the back side of refrigerator.

4. Peel off all the tapes. The door should automatically close when it's half opened. If not, check the levels.

5. Keep your refrigerator neat and clean to use it for years.

Happy cooling. üòä",4.2

870,This fridge was brought for my grandmother's house .and it has been more than one year .the whirl pool executives'call me after 1 year to check on the condition of the fridge the customer service is also good. There has been no problems with the working of the fridge and it doesn't use too much electricity,4.2
871,Main refrigerator lene ka soch raha tha. Par bahut jyada refrigerators dekhne ke bad mujhe Whirpool ka ye refrigerator achha laga. Jo log is comapany ka refrigerator lene ka soch rahe hai; main unko ye refrigerator suggest karunga. Thank you Whirpool...,4.2
872,Product is good. The delivery guy opened in front and confirmed the product quality. But during transit the good was handled very casually and there was a small dent on the door due to this.,4.2
873,"Very nice product , cooling is also awesome , myt face some issue regarding refrigerator creating sone sound , but all just because of the alignment , an authorised representative would visit and would check it in for each and every measure .
Must buy if your budget is low .
Efficient , cheap, decent and nice service people.",4.2
874,"Got it @ 9k during offer period...
Works fine...
Value for moneyüëå

1 more thing...
Whirlpool agents will try to persuade u to buy stabilizer from them.... Don't b fooled... Company has clearly mentioned about in-built stabilizer & no need for extra stabilizer (screenshot attached)

Enjoy ur fridgeü§óü§ó",4.2
875,"Best in this price tag, I bought this in 10450 , timely delivery made me happy and on top of that visit of whirpool service agent who gave us brief description of the product .he Shared phone number to call if in case of any issue.

Product is also really awesome, love amazon love whirpool!!",4.2
876,"i got it at a real good price and it's been working fine since day 1. my food is preserved very nicely, maybe the electricity consumption is slightly higher given its *** rating, however it's not much of a botheration for me, as a bachelor.",4.2
877,Nice product. This color really looks nice. Has defrost button. Cooling capacity is very good need to keep on lower level. Claims stabilizer free and i did faced power cuts nothing happened so looks good,4.2
878,"I'm happy with the fridge but inside the quick cool tray has broken. I wanted to go for replacement but as a satisfied with the Amazon I cancelled the return.
If possible please send me the tray.",4.2
879,Delivered on-time as scheduled. Good exchange value more than open market for old working 165L refrigerator with out any issue. Delivery person was very co-operative. Happy to purchase this item from Amazon,4.2
880,"When i opened the packing i found that there are no legs in the refrigerator and its not even stand properly because of base plate of compressor, very light built product, don't expect robust quality with this price range. good for couples.

called Service center for legs installation separately. i think legs are not included in this packaging .",4.2
881,"Well, i live in a rented place alone on 4 floor. Amazon guys called me and they bring the fridge on 4 floor they were quite supportive. The fridge was great so far. The guy even checked it for me and said please check if any issue u have, he also said that we have 10 days replacement if any issue occur. The next day the guy from Whirlpool company came and inspected the fridge and asked if u have any questions do let me know. I am really amazed by the amazon facility. I have purchased many things from amazon, and everthing is good. I would recommend for this fridge if u are looking for a good appliance. The plastic inside the fridge is looks cheap but in this price, i think u dont have to think much.
It is only been 1 week i m using the fridge so will update the condition :)

882,"It's good and all but the description given here isn't the same. There is only one ice tray and not 2 trays as mentioned here in description.
They said it doesn't require installation but it's better to call them for installation. Buy it with a stand coz the base of the fridge touches the floor.
Whirlpool engineer said it's better to use fridge with a stabilizer.",4.2
883,"Very Basic Design but best in class. I got this in the Summer Sale @ just rs.9600 (including 10% discount for using my icici credit card). It was on no cost emi and I think that's one if the best part. The fridge looks nice, color is a bit different than the displayed picture but its a must buy for a small family. The engineer from Whirlpool came in after the delivery day but he helped in installing the product, also shared information about the product....the delivery was on time by Amazon, as always! Hope to share a positive feedback once I use this product for a while.",4.2
884,"First of all thanks to Amazon for the perfect and timely delivery as requested.
1. It is really a value for money purchase I would say as it quite simple and elegant but the colour is on the lighter side than it is shown in the pic.
2.delivery boys unpacked to check if there is any damage.
3. I switched it on after they went directly as it was mentioned in the product details that it comes with inbuilt stabilizer and no need of any installation.
4. To my surprise the whirlpool company technician calls me after sometime and asking me for the delivery and he said he will be coming down for the installation and asked me if I have a stabilizer with me or he have to bring one which is of the same company. When enquired he said all the company products will be only 90% on inbuilt stabilizer so better I should keep one. Since I did not have a choice I bought it from him for Rs.1900, which had 12 months replacement warranty
So amazon when giving a product details everything should be mentioned whether company instalation should be done or is there a requirement of a stabilizer etc. So that a customer can be prepared and avoid surprises.
Apart from this I really loved the product for now, its a value for money. I ll get with the product review after few months of usage",4.2
885,"Overall the fridge is good and cools well.
Pros:
-Good looking and compact
-Easy to install
-Fridge has light
-Sufficient for a small family for 2-3 members
-Ice tray is provided by feel quite large ice pieces.

Cons:
-Not automatic defrosting. Need to press a button every 3-4 days to defrost.
-The light bulb got fused within a month of operation. Called the Customer care and had to get the bulb replaced. I was told that it is due to voltage fluctuation and need to get a stabilizer. So had to buy a stabilizer and spent another 2k.
-No in built stabilizer",4.2
886,"This is a value for money refrigerator good enough for a small family. Even with a setting of the regulator at 2 it cools very efficiently. Noise level is almost nil. Quite spacious and you may install it by yourself. One may simply go in for it. Stabilizer is not required although the company representatives call you up and ""advise"" you that it's necessary in order to sell one unit. Since the company itself represents that the fridge has a stabilizer free operation, in my humble opinion it is not required.",4.2
887,"The product is supposed to have only 2 legs. Not 4. The back of the fridge comes with inbuilt support. 2 legs are for the Front side. These legs you have to install yourself.
These 2 legs are in a sealed Packet INSIDE THE VEGETABLE BOX IN THE FRIDGE. Here is what you need to know to install them right üëâ

- One is small, One is big. That is supposed to be like that.
- They have a screw like end which will fit like a normal screw in the bottom of the Fridge.

This is What you do üëá
1. Tilt the fridge. I did it alone so I completely rested it on its side, placing the packing thermacol under it.

2. In the base, in each corner you will see one Hole, for the screw to fit in.

3. MOST IMPORTANT. Say you are facing the fridge, then The SMALL leg goes on your RIGHT side, and the BIG leg goes on the LEFT side. In other words, on the side on which the Door opens, you fit the BIG leg.

Thats it. Fit these two in and the fridge should be stable and straight. If it isn't, just loosen one of the screws till it is straight.",4.2
888,"It's really good with in this budget. Customer care response was really good. They called me for warranty registration and friendly.

Best feature is fast icing technology. If you are good ice-cream maker then this fridge is for you. It's keeping food fresh for 5-7 days. Only issue I am facing is that it can't hold more than 8 1 liter bottles. I mean juices, water, ketchup put to gether you feel confused, as you can see there is no place for me to put water in the fridge. Other things occupied. House wife's can easily manage this with their skill.

I am single bachelor and doing its job for me...",4.2
889,"I have used this fridge for about a month and it has given me no issues thus far. I think, i could have gotten it cheaper than ‚Çπ11200/-. It's cooling is really good. Do not forget to make a video and check for dents/damage when you receive this and make sure you do it before submitting the OTP code to the delivery agent. Once you turn it on and everything works only then should you give the OTP to the delivery agent. Also wait for whirlpool's guy to come, installing this Fridge's legs is a bit dicey.",4.2
890,The legs are yet not fixed cos the installation guy never came even after he promised to come and I gave up. Has only one Ice tray when it‚Äôs supposed to have 2. It does the job and am happy.,4.2
891,"Very Good refrigerator , silent and giving good service and value for Money .
Only thing is has 2 small dent on the right side and this I found the same in few more reviews also .
Hope to get this rectified by Amazon or Seller in the coming days .
Overall good one and nice product with decent price",4.2
892,"It's a very good purchase at this rate.
It produces the sound of something falling down now and then.
The bottom is also not on a level even after the front legs are adjusted.
But they don't appear as major defects.",4.2
893,"Got the refrigerator delivered within Amazon time frame. However nobody came to do the installation and I had to do it myself.
Very easy to setup and install. The refrigerator is best in this price segment. Fantastic cooling. Vegetable stays fresh for a week.
The freezer freezes ice within 2hrs.
Also the refrigerator has a good spacing to keep variety of things.
Negative :
* The freezer gets full of Ice within 1 week and you need to Defrost the refrigerator every 1 week.
* The water compartment is not very easy to pull out. A sudden pull scatters the water over the compressor.
* There is no legs stand at rear end. The body keep touching the floor",4.2
894,"Problem with the 3 pin plug wire which is very short. You have to keep your refrigerator exactly front of the plug point without keep much distance from back wall with specific angle.The outlet pipe not in the centre of outlet water tray. The shelves are simple small grill. I expected shelves would be glass made. The side door tray has big gap, so it you put a tomato or apple it will dropped on the floor.",4.2
895,"Full of hard ice formation inside the freezer. Whirlpool service is done by some unqualified team. Looks like thermostat issue they are suggesting us to defrost every 3 days. Even overall build was very light and flimsy.

Update:

Whirlpool replaced my new fridge for the above defects.",4.2
896,"Like: We have been using.in our.bachelors room for more than 2 years. It is very good and I bought one again for my home. Value for money. Functions great.

Dislike: The right leg in front is not fitting. When the whirlpool representative came for installation, he just positioned the refridgerator in slanting and left. I was disappointed after getting to know this from my dad and mom.",4.2
897,Good product with affordable price. It is good for a family of 3. Please take the defrosting stabolizer. It won't cost more and keep the fridge in good condition. It will defrost automatically...so if u are a lazy person or who can forget small things or don't have time then this stabilizer will help you a lot in defrosting the frost cabinet. Over all it is working as awesome. Loving it by using.,4.2
898,I m writing this after regular use within a month of September . nice product and less noise . just plug n play option no need to call mechanic . it's fits for 5 people . cooling is best no any issue in cooling or making ice .. product is only 3 star. In my opinion if you looking for a budget refrigerator than go for it.... thanks amazon to this good product and on time delivery..,4.2
899,"For a family of 3-4 people its very great.
Cooling is great at lowest setting also
This have 2 litre bottle holder for upto 3 bottles which you definately need in summer.

I kept around 10 kg of Wight on the single drawer and it held which I was surprised.

Overall good, just the colour is little dull if you put some stickers, it can go with any household.",4.2
900,NO COMPANY PERSON CAME FOR INSTALLATION OR DEMO EVEN AFTER TEN DAYS. WE OUR OWN INSTALLED AND STARTED USING. SINCE IT IS REFRIGERATOR WE DONE OUR OWN. IF IT MAY BE TV OR WASHING MACHINE WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL THEY COME WITHOUT USING.,4.2
901,"Worth to buy with this price range. It's cheaper than shop and delivered at home withpit extra cost.
The only challange is the ice block the freezer door even in medium temperature. You have to defrost in evry 3days and its mentioned in manual as well",4.2
902,The product is good in budget but they have provided wire shelves. It would have been better if they would have given fiberglass shelves instead. Yet cooling is very efficient,4.2
903,"This is a base level no frills fridge and is easy to install and use. Ideal for a small family. The flip side is that the defrost has to be done manually and not automatic.
Otherwise, the product is good and response from the Whirlpool team was timely and informatve.",4.2
904,Nice product with in that price range. Need to defrost once in a week atleast.,4.2
905,"The product was in good shape and without any scratch or damage. Overall it was good. However, the ice box is 8 inches less than my old 190 ltr fridge. Hence you can expect less space. Function is good.",4.2
906,The wire connecting to electricity is very short and definitely Customers want at least another 2 feet of more length.You can cut down on non essentials but not on basics.,4.2
907,Really Good. Efficient delivery by Amazon. Well worth the price. No Stabilizer is required. I have been using it for couple of months now and working well. Very good customer service from whirlpool,4.2
908,"Got it for 10500 inr, worth every penny.. even in the mArket the lowest 190ltrs refrigerator cost around 13000.

Would like to thank amazon for prompt service.

Installation done by whirlpool.",4.2
909,Basic good refrigerator in a reasonable budget. Works noiseless. Does not heatup much on outside. Finish and appearance is good.,4.2
910,"The refrigerator is delivered on time. Installed immediately.

But, the third party company who does the installation insisted on we buying a new stabilizer from the installation agent on the spot. My parents unaware of the cheating gave them around Rs2000 for stabilizer as they asked the same.

After that I received calls asking for 3 digit code on my phone on which amazon account is tied to.

Below are the two cheatings by installation agent
1. Stabilizer is not needed for this model to get warranty, as it will work on the most fuctuation zones (130V to 200v).( I did verify this by calling whirlpool customer support.) It rarely shoots above 200V. Most often it is below 200V. For sudden surges above 200 V, stabilizer may be needed. But a stabilizer is not a must for claiming warranty against all defects except surges.
2. After installation customer gets an sms with a 3 digit satisfaction code. The installation agent asked for this satisfaction code. I didn't give it. Installation agent is a third party company. They will put high rating for customer rating on the installation. Don't give your satisfaction code to installation agent unless it is mentioned in the sms to do so.

I had a previous refrigerator from whirlpool and a stabilizer with it. Never needed a second stabilizer.

Why should I buy an over priced stabilizer from an installation agent? Putting a cheating case in local police station against installation agent.",4.2
911,"Poor preshipment quality checks at the Amazon end. Need some one to visit with the replacement Tray as soon as possible.
Regarding the scratches, let Amazon use its Corporate wisdom and convey the decision. Pls refer the pictures attached.",4.2
912,"I have a very worst experience during delivery. I had to take the delivery at my own cost from the distribution hub.DELIVERY courier service is horrible.They doesnt have any contact no other than toll free. Toll free customer service is also bad. Always blaming customers that address cannot be found whereas delivery process not initiated from the nearest dustribution centre.

In respect to refrigerator Two Front stands are missing as displayed in the picture catalogue. Refrigerator cannot be kept properly and leaning towards front. At the back side the net panel is bent.

Thanks to god that its working.",4.2
913,Received the Fridge but technician who has come to install says it does not come with stabilizer free operation and recommended to buy a stabilizer and also it came with only one ice tray not two. The fridge stands slightly slanted towards the back. I am somewhat neutral right now so giving 3 star.,4.2
914,"Whirlpool Refrigerator - the delivery was on schedule. The personnel unboxed it for verification. The refrigerator was unstable and tilting to the front. Therefore the delivery person was requested to mount it on the thermocole base prior to their departure. They informed us that an installation team would come in and set up the refrigerator. After numerous calls / conversations with the customer care, we were informed that that this product has no installation procedure. All executives, supervisors and technicians offered replacement of fridge, refund of money but no solution to set up the fridge. After two days, we called our own technicians, mounted the adjustable stands and removed the thermocole base.
The adjustable stands were part of the refrigerator; the delivery personnel while undertaking the verification, did not mention it. What verification did they conduct and submit a report. The Amazon executives, supervisors and technicians I spoke to were not aware of this adjustable stand or the procedure to fix it. Lastly the toll free number of the manufacturer on the refrigerator was inaccessible, I wonder how I will contact anybody if there is a breakdown 6 months later.",4.2
915,"As i purchased the above product it is worth for family contains 3 to 5 members..

Some of the disadvantage are there while installing the fridge there was 2 stand bushes has been provided for front side alone that is the great idea and its is adjustable bush .But going to the back side there is no bush has been provide but there is steel body that can sit in the stand but i would like to suggest the company to put the bushes in the bcak side it would be very use full to fix the fridge easily without damage or scratches while fixing the fridge we got scratches in the back side if the bushes has been provide we can avoid the scratches",4.2
916,"You can't even put in ice cube trays front to back. Has some useless plastic pretend egg holder that doesn't hold eggs at all. No butter compartment. I must say I expected better from Whirlpool. My ancient 3 star, no name fridge was designed better. It looks fine on the outside and was delivered quickly, but good lord - what were they thinking with this miniscule freezer!",4.2
917,"The refrigerator was delivered in the 3rd week of November, 2020.
Whirlpool service centre did respond courteously and sent engineer within 48 hrs.
The refrigerator worked properly for 14 days and then stopped cooling.

Complaint was again lodged with service centre, and engineer reported next day.
Opined that there were no cooling gas, due to leakage in pipe, and further added that the pipes were damaged due to transportation.
He fixed it, al least that's what he said.
Such an occurrence was not expected from a product of Whirlpool, which was shipped by Amazon",4.2
918,"I got his product few days before. Inner look is good. Overall satisfied with the product.
Small scratch was there right side to the refrigerator.

Delivery:
Horrible delivery by amazon this time. Product was reached to delivery location as expected.
They took 4 days to deliver it to my home. Daily morning they will call saying today your product is out for delivery and end of the day i will receive messaged like due to some reason we are unable to deliver your product. Finally after 4 days delivered it to me.",4.2
919,Almost impossible for stable installation due to faulty base(managed leaning it to wall!). Compressor not attached to body properly and at risk of damage unless careful while shifting. Noisy shaking of body whenever compressor gets on.,4.2
920,"Bought this thinking Whirlpool is a good brand, knew this was a basic model but assumed would be good. But this freezes too much even with basic setting, have to defrost often - manual says once in 3 day's but whrilpool service guy who came mentions to defrost every other day. Even after defrosting the fridge will connect water inside. Called customer care twice and engineer visited twice but no use. Pathetic product, don't go for it.",4.2
921,Got the product intact. Writing this review after watching the performance for 5 months. The fridge is freezing even in minimum adjustment. Pl don't go for whirlpool. I was once a lover of whirlpool now have become just opposite after seeing the performance of their washing machine & this fridge.,4.2
922,Good Color. Good Space. Okay for small Family. Only demerit I found is back side no proper base or leg to sit on Stand. Manytimes adjusted on stand then also not fitting properly. Can exactly give rating after using for 6 months,4.2
923,Electric consumption is more than what other 2star fridge consume.,4.2
924,It weeps like anything after defrost...The water trough is too small and defrost water just flows out on floor about 3 ft around...everytime...even after one weak defrost or lower settings of cool.,4.2

 Still packed. The delivery boy removed from d box but not able to stand properly, it's one sided..please check and if damaged replace it. No installation engineer available from Amazon",4.2

 I purchased for personal use. Over all working fine but weight is not suitable. So not recommended for long term use",4.2
932,Cooling control system is not working properly. Water droplets are falling on food items which is causing food spoils. Excess water comes out from refrigerator..,4.2
933,Old model with old configuration,4.2
934,"In the product details it is mentioned in built stabilizer but the technician who came and installed asked for stabilizer also needs to be used for this model of fridge. If ao was the case, why incorrect information is mentioned on Amazon.",4.2
935,Good refrigerator to have for budget people,4.2
936,"Received with unsymmetrical door surface so inspect properly once received. Blue color looks good .no stand required ,no stabilizer used as of now.Gr8 for family of 4",4.2

2. Cooling is good.
3. Noise free operation.",4.2
938,"It was not easy to install as refrigerator get tilt on back side, you need to manual set some packing below to keep it stand but on regular use it won't work, this basic things needed to be improve",4.2
939,"Impossible to fix the left leg, no assistant from vendor after one month",4.2
940,"The light in the fridge was not working when i got the delivery.. so I raised a request to get it fixed as it is in warranty.. they said ""you have to pay for it as there is no warranty if you buy on Amazon"".. however crazy it may sound I thought fine.. i'll pay.. but they couldn't fix it as it is some wiring problem.. service technician said if you got it in a store we would have replaced it.. apart from that fridge is working fine no issues.. but still i won't recommend anyone buying large appliances online..",4.2

But yes bcoz of this problem i have already used two new refrigerators in 7 months. And after warrenty it shoud be.....???,4.2
942,"For a family of six, needed a second fridge. This one is the cheapest model available in Amazon.

Pros: Cheap, quick chill
Cons: not frost free and even with minimal Temperature setting the frost sets in every other day. One time, I had to defrost twice in a day. Secondly, the frozen shelf is very small and runs the risk of bending should one tries to pull something. Recommended for light usage only.",4.2
943,Product delivered in time but there is only one leg another one is missing so that the Fridge cannot stand properly,4.2
944,"Although I am a Whirlpool fan, but this particular product has disappointed me to a great extent. It‚Äôs NOT a frost-free refrigerator, as advertised, but needs manual adjustments for defrosting. A foul smell also is generated by the product. Service is less than fair too.",4.2

The installation guy never came! I installed myself. Within an year of that the compressor stopped working. Again no technician came. This time their excuse is the ""covid lockdown"". After endless hours of explain endlessly to their call centrw employees about my fridge, no help is proviy, all they tell you is to wait. Its all such a long pathetic story that i feel i cant write it all.
All i can say is never buy anything whirlpool. Poor product and equally poor after sales service. So save ur time money n energyüôè.

975,"I have purchased this product on Mar 2019. After 1.5 years of usage it stopped working. Called for service from Whirlpool service and technician came after one week of my complaint. He confirmed that Compressor had problem so need to replace under warranty and paid Rs.350 for visiting. It has been 15 days after his visit so far no update. Today I called whirlpool customer care and took feedback that it will take 45 days to fulfill my request. Also Technician told that After installation of compressor gas charges are not cover from warranty and it is extra cost of Rs.2500. in the cities like Bangalore and Chennai Gas charges are varying from 600 to 1500. It is too worst that Company service center has no fixed charges on service. Not at all recommend Whirlpool again in my entire Life.
Note: I have used LG and Godrej Refrigerator earlier and no issues even after 12 years.",4.2
976,"It's one of the worst products out there. I bought it exactly a year ago and this fridge hasn't done anything but to disappoint me.
I thought I'm getting it for a great prize but it'd be better if I had bought a second hand appliance. The material is very cheap and the ice gate broke in 2 days only. I am so mad to buy this but never gonna trust Whirlpool again. BAD QUALITY. BAD WARRANTY.",4.2
977,"It's been a few months, the refrigerator was okay but making a bit of noise and recently it has stopped month, for a month we tried contacting customer support and service people for the same, despite 100s of attempts nobody showed up to repair the refrigerator which is very disappointing and unethical.",4.2
978,"1. Back completely exposed. All the wires compressor etc. No pictures mentioning the same.

2. Not a frost free fridge. Keep it is medium cooling and whole fridge becomes a deep freezer.

Spend a 1000 more and buy a better fridge.",4.2
979,"Writing this review after 2 weeks of purchase. Soon after receiving it, I found it has only 2 legs and doesn‚Äôt stand level to the ground (Angled towards the rear and shakes when doors are opened). After multiple calls with amazon, couple of engineers visit, I was told that this is how it is which this particular model. Max they offered was replacement but then that would not solve the issue. Got whirlpool engineer to visit and same result. Wasted my money on a stand too. Advice: don‚Äôt buy this model and don‚Äôt buy from any seller who do not offer returns. Talking to amazon service or their engineers will only waste your time.",4.2
980,"So overall, the fridge is cheap. So after few months I discovered a unique design!! The defrost stray is ""FIXED"" to the fridge right above the compressor. The tray/bucket has deep groves in it. So if you defrost the water collect in this BUCKET.
One day we figured the kitchen was stinking and after searching for while, the smell was coming from the back. Yes the defrosted water has been collecting there. Around 5liters of stinky drain water. With no way to drain apart from sing some tools ans special skills to remove it. Basically they say its not self serviceable, you need to call the engineer for this. So every time you defrost... I guess you get the point.
Also defrosting takes 2 whole days!",4.2
981,Don't ever buy this 3rd class refrigerators from Amazon. Bad quality product and cheap customer service of Amazon. They don't deliver what they commit. They don't replace or return.,4.2
982,"I bought this Whirlpool fridge last week, it arrived prime in only 1 day, which was great, but as soon as i plugged it in I noticed that the compressor was not coming on. I called whirlpool to ask how long it takes to cool, and they said a few hours. The next morning, it had still not cooled. So i called whirlpool, who said they would send someone out. They sent out a person, who said that the compressor does not work and it seems the fridge is more than 1 year old! I requested a return and replace from Amazon, but they said this is not a priority and hence the will return/replace only after 6 days. So, i have no fridge for about a week. Thanks whirlpool, amazon, and the merchant, for sending me a broken fridge and leaving me with no fridge for a week. Very nice.",4.2
983,"We got call from customer care for product demonstration. We told them that we do not require any demonstration. They said ok and the call ended. Later on that day we got another call from customer care. They asked for the confirmation whether we said that we do not require demonstration and we confirmed. After that they said if you do not allow us for demonstration, you will not be eligible for warranty. If your product would have any issue during warranty period , you have to pay for it.
If the claim from customer care is true, I would like to go for other brand where this clause may be false",4.2
984,"Very cheap plastic, ice tray broken in just 3 months, vegetables bucket got cracked in 4 months, if calling to service center service center manager using bad way to talk, and telling to talk to Amazon they will give you service whirlpool is not responsible for warranty.",4.2
985,"Whirlpool services are the most pathetic. I have been waiting for the service technician to come and check and install this and they have not visited and it has been 5 days already. If u want good service, better avoid whirlpool.
Update: the technician never came. I ended up installing myself with some friend's help. Also, I asked for a replacement & amazon can replace it only if whirlpool fills some jobsheet - they claim to do it within 24 hours but it never happened.
The fridge is also smaller than it looks and I really doubt it really is 190 ltrs. The storage space is small and even on the door it isn't spacious.
I would never recommend to get anything from whirlpool - this is the worst kind of service/response I have faced in my life.",4.2
986,"Ghatiya product hai guys ,don't buy any electronic appliances from Amazon,they cheat you..the replacement period is of 10days and product works for exactly 10days ..after 2 weeks of usage paint and door rubber started coming out ,now u have to pay to repair the new product(which i guess is refurbished as paint is still sticky)as plasctic and rubber parts are not under waranty ,it's better u buy 10th hand from bhangar waala and get it repaired and use it.would be much better and cheaper atleast u won't feel cheated ,same thing happend to my purifier which I bought on the same date froma amazon only....it stopped working after 17days approx .",4.2
987,Initially everything worked well. I have been a satisfied customer of whirlpool in the past but this time somehow feeling cheated within 3 months of purchase as refrigerator has stopped giving sufficient cooling even to form ice. I have Lodged a complaint and waiting for the resolution. Let's hope for good.,4.2

Even if you defrost within just 2 days, water still comes out of the bucket. When we don‚Äôt defrost, the freezer door doesn‚Äôt open; also the cooling is not good enough to keep ice cream.",4.2
996,Product is damaged.,4.2

1.Great display. The screen is very wide and great for watching movies or online classes
2. The processing speed is good with no lags
3. The user interface is good
4. Good for online classes and entertainment
5. The sound quality is amazing If you compare this with SAMSUNG A7 wifi at 16k, then the price you will be paying for this tablet is totally worth it as you will get a much better tablet with good specs at a lower price. Furthermore, the tablet build quality and form factor just add on the great usage experience In a nutshell, it's the best tablet in this price range. Though there are some compromises to be made as the battery life could have been better. However the battery lasts for several hours while logging into online classes or watching movies so is manageable.

Overall I am rating this tablet a 5 star. If you are looking for a great tablet for learning, entertainment and general use purposes with great looks, speed and price this is the one for you.",4

1003,"Extremely happy about the product! Prompt delivery by Amazon.
UPDATE:- charging time 19% to 90% Took 2hrs for 5000 mah backup which is not good also not bad.
It's upto user perspective.
But battery management is awesome. Screen resolution is slightly lesser (1920 X 1200p) then full HD so you can seal black bar's in top bottom when watching and streaming video online.

Pros. Battery,speaker,screen watching videos and movies.
Wi-Fi connectivity is awesome. No lag.
4GB RAM and 128 GB Storage for this price is very good.
No heating issues even while charging in videos are Running.
Google Home Support is awesome.

Cons. Lenovo should improve the the software. Though it gives pure Android experience, Icons are not crisp but while watching video screen it's amazingly clear.!!!!",4
1004,"I got this tablet after looking around on the Ecomm sites for close to a week. I use the tablet as a replacement for laptop for managing my office work and it‚Äôs working absolutely fine.
I use the tablet for these activities:
1. Google Meet meetings
2. Office emails on GMAIL.
3. Viewing PDF documents.
4. Office docs on Google Drive

I also got myself a Bluetooth keyboard to work with the tablet. Over the last two weeks I realised that I am using the laptop less and less.
I get a battery life of around a day with a screen time of around 3 hours with 80% brightness. I have a JIO sim for Internet which is on VOLTE. If I use home WiFi then the battery life is greater by around an hour or so.

The screen size is big and bright. The resolution is less which is a good thing we don‚Äôt need a very high resolution for normal use and the battery life and cpu performance is better with this optimum resolution

I haven‚Äôt used the tablet for gaming so cannot comment there.

I am happy and satisfied.",4

I bought this tablet for my kid for his online classes.

Pros-
The sound quality is very good.
Display is good enough for online classes and other video playing requirements
The finish on the outside of the tablet is very good

Processing speed of the tablet is good

The 32GB memory allows my son to store all his homework related files and other study material easily

The tablet also has a TUV certified display to prevent harmful light emitted from the tablet from hurting your eyes.",4

 Product is pretty good. I guess if you are not an artist this tab and pen would work for any normal work. Supports palm rejection well.
The didn't come with spare nib. That was a bit saddening because in most cases companies provide spare nib but good thing is that it works with AAA batteries and you can get rechargeable one if needed but I guess battery last quite long on theses pens.",4
1008,"I did a lot of research before buying this tablet... read loads of online reviews, watched unboxing videos, followed thread on various forums, and spoke to several techies in my circle. I rejected several low-end brands. The choice eventually boiled down to Lenovo versus Samsung. Amazon had a better deal on the Lenovo so that helped me finalize my decision.

No regrets! This is an excellent tablet at this price. Here are the highlights:

Design: Very sleek, very smart!

Usability: Intuitive navigation with the all-too-familiar Google interface.

Display Quality: Bright, crisp and easy to read.

Sound: Pretty loud - which makes it a great device for watching YouTube videos and movies.

Speed: Good - so far, no buffering or hang mode issues.

Build: Excellent - feels like a premium product. Does not have a ""plastic-y"" feel at all.

Battery: Good, really good.

Bottom Line: Overall, based on multiple parameters, this has (so far) been a very good choice. I got the tablet at a special offer price of INR 14,999/- and this made the deal sweeter!",4
1009,"For gaming this might be a little downer, but for everything else this one is a clear winner.

You're getting a calling tablet with 4gb RAM and 128gb Internal Storage. What else can you ask for at this price?

Screen response time is superb, so is screen quality. No lags apart from in games. Battery life is 4-6 hours easily, may last more depending on usage. I used it for 8 hours straight (games and YouTube) while charging and didn't heat up at all.",4

Video - Amazing
I have bought it for online classes and for entertainment purposes such as watching movies online , which I think would be the best use for this tab
The tablet build quality is awesome with a wide display and watching movies or logging into online classes then becomes a great experience in a wider display
Just go for it",4
1012,"I was highly confused whether to buy this tab or go with samsung tab, but believe me this tab is far better than samsung tab

REASON FOR BOT GOING WITH SAMSUNG
1.exyonos processor
2.no 4g support
3. I don't like samsung because I have experienced that samsung introduces bugs in their devices after 1year, make it extremely slow

I had Samsung m30s ,intially it worked like butter but after 1year it hangs too much
*Four year same happened with my samsung galaxy J2

4.YOU MAY BE CONFUSED THAT SAMSUNG HAS BIGGER BATTERY ,BUT BELIEVE ME THIS TAB ALTHOUGH HAS 5100MAH BATTERY BUT IT LAST FOR FULL 1DAY ON HEAVY USEAGE

5.speaker output is also good

YOU SHOULD GO FOR THIS TAB WITHOUT ANY DOUBT",4
1013,"Package comprises of tablet, slot pin, charging cable and adapter.
The tab is good for reading, 2d sketching, 3d AR sketching, binge watching, all MS OFFICE usages and gaming ( if interested). It comes with 4gb RAM 128gb Internal memory and can be extended to 512gb external memory. AR supported, VR not supported! Best for python coding, php, html, Javascript. All github and repositories supported for programming. Minimum processing time, Fastest facial recognition, Voice modulated controls possible by using concurring applications, good noise cancelation while wifi calling, external speakers are quite loud with enough base (no need of extra speakers!). It is compatible for fast charging via c type charger , it also comes with smart charging sockets on bottom edge of tablet.

 Let's keep it simple.
Pros:
1) best is battery backup. Gives screen time more than 1.6 day. Which is brilliant.(see image)
2) screen quality is great. The eye protection works well. And the dark mode is awesome.
3) Navigation is great.
4) Dual Speakers supports Dolby Atmos.
5) type c charging port.
6) the tab is beautiful even to look at.

Pros ps: I mainly use this for my jee preparation and reading books(and sometimes movies). Before I used to use laptop which was bulky and consumed a lot of power. But this is perfect for anyone like me.

Cons:
1) Speakers could have been better. It's loud for a room but still if it can be in cons.....
2) If you buy this for gaming you will be ruined. This tab(2gb) cannot support games. It will shut down as soon as you open it.
3) For the price range cameras are fine.
4) if you are a heavy user then go for the 4gb variant. As I have stated earlier if you buy this only for small task then it does it's job fine.
5) there is a little lag.

Final ps: I am using this for 4 months now. And I can guarantee you that this is quite fine and value for money. The tab is well built. Amazon also delivers it in time.

Thanks lenevo and Amazon.",4
1015,"Writing review after usage of 30+ days.
Pros -
1. RAM 4GB, does not feel any lag, things work smooth
2. Internal memory is 128GB, so huge space to use.
3. CPU is also good with good clock speed n cores, so processing/instructions are fast.
4. 10 inches screen, perfect for attending calls on MS team or Zoom.
5. Speaker volume is good, one can take calls via pad speakers.
6. I got in 17k, so it was a best deal.
7. Not played games so can't say on that front.

Cons -

Overall verdict, in all a good package and VFM.",4
1016,"After using it for a month, I am writing this review. I wanted a device to read a few things and I was confused between Kindle and a tablet. I purchased this finally. This tablet allows to me read from lot of sources like News Apps, Oreilly App and Kindle as well. I see it as an excellent alternative for Kindle.

Pros:
1. Screen is excellent for reading (actually its pretty large) and there are features that keeps your eyes comfortable for reading. I use it around 1-1.30 hour per day. Multiple news apps, Oreilly, Coursera and Youtube.

2. Good battery life. For my light reading and browsing, it easily lasts for 8-9 days for 1-1.30 hour per day usage.

3. Dolby Audio - Audio is excellent in both earphones and speaker mode. Although I don't use audio much, I tried out and it was good!

Cons:
1. I saw many reviews before buying and some of them had a screen issue within a week. I am not sure if its a seller issue or the customer was not careful, but anyway my biggest fear is the screen issue. Its not Gorilla glass, so I am being very careful even after a month.",4
1017,"This tab was beyond my expectation. Everything is good about this my child uses this for online classes. The display could've been a little better and brighter, however it doesn't matter. The Active pen 3 is no nonsense, just load with battery and use it right away. Hope to use for couple of weeks and order one more.",4
1018,"Nothing to complain about, except that the charging cable supplied is not very long.and the front facing camera is average at best. Otherwise, It is in fact an awesome tablet that performs very well even with multiple apps or browser windows open. The form factor and size (10.3 inches) makes it slightly large for one handed operation though. If you want to use it like a phone, it is better to go for an 8 inch.",4

If lenovo decided not to include the a biometric login, they should have optimised face detection, becuase face detection on this device is pre historic. This could be great tablet if lenovo can optimise the current software with an update. Budget phones which are less than 10k have better software.",4

Yes the processor might be old, but for just entertainment and basic office work it's got enough firepower. The feel of the tablet is great, it feels premium to hold, fhd screen works great and touch sensitivity is very good too. I was frankly advised not go for it and spend more on an S6 lite or ipad.

Missing info or Good to have:
1. Availability of Native apps or various apps from lenovo itself.
2. Active Pen configuration, related apps
3. Photo album/gallery app
4. Split screen/multi screen functionality
5. Though have phone dialer, but no ringtone configuration etc, you can not expect it or work like mobile phone dialer or call related configuration

Can work as a laptop if you add a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to it. A smartphone can never compete with a tablet, where it's use as a cheap computer is considered.

Full HD resolution of 1920*1200 definitely helps while reading and other stuff.

Also if you are going to multi-task a lot, 4GB Ram variant should be the choice. The 2 GB one I got fails to multitask a bit and forgets the stored content on other apps.

1045,I thought that this tab is just for reading and for online classes . But the MediaTek Helio P22T OCTACORE made gaming very smooth and battery life lastes upto 6hrs on continue gaming and 128GB storage is very very good for storing movies and photos and the camera quality is good you cannot expect more quality of camera and it's brightness is very good for indoor usage and not more in out door and the sound quality with Dolby Atoms is beast perfomance and this tab is Fantastic in just 20K,4
1046,"It's good tab.. Must buy.. I got it in sale for 18 k only and u shud go for 4gb n 128 .. Thts best not lower thn this for light use.. Everything is perfect. Dnt go in other reviews they might b for 2gb /3gb config... This 4gb is best one,.......................",4
1047,"I was looking for a medium sized screen to read on Kindle App, e news papers and watch Youtube. The tab is ideal for all these. I do not play games on this, but when I tried something, it was a bit slow. Otherwise streaming videos, music etc are wonderful.",4
1048,"Excellent product, fit for all puspose use, Online Classes, enjoy movies, play game, read e-book, even calling facility available using Sim. Works both with sim as well wifi. Go for this 4GB RAM for better performance than 2GB RAM",4
1049,"A very good quality product and happy receive the product in time, I am fully satisfied with the product. On part of packaging as it is a costly product it should have been packed in another hardboard box instead of only in polythene bag.",4
1050,"For the price of 20K, you're getting a 10.3-inch 1920x1200 display with 128GB storage - it's as good as it can get in this price range.

Analysis:

1. Display:
It is a brilliant IPS panel with good color range. It allows pretty wide viewing with minimal color change over extreme angles, and has a 16:10 ratio. On paper, it is slightly bigger than most tablets - they are all 10.1 inches while this is 10.3. In the portrait mode it is as wide as two Redmi Note 8 Pro screens side by side - which makes it quite good for reading and browsing. A4 pages zoomed in to fit edges look great because of its extra width. Brightness isn't the highest I have seen. It has OK sunlight readability for outdoor reading/surfing. But movies/videos are best watched indoors because screen isn‚Äôt matte ‚Äì It‚Äôs quite reflective in medium brightness and you‚Äôll need a matte screen cover if you want to avoid those.
It has a 'Productivity Mode' under display settings which turns the bottom Navigation bar into PC/Mac-like Taskbar, where are all your open apps appear as icons and can be opened/closed directly without going into overview/task-manager mode. The home/back/task navigation buttons are pushed to corner, which can be used with a thumb. Neat. It will take some getting used to, but this mode works better for me than standard navigation gestures.

Note: If you're myopic/near-sighted and want to use tablet up close without using your glasses, you're going to see a lot of ‚Äòpixelation‚Äô in written text, 'cause this isn't a retina/UHD panel.
Eye protection mode works well and you can read books for a very long time without straining your eyes. This, along with Auto-Brightness, Reading Mode and big screen size make you feel like as if you're reading an actual paper book instead of watching it on screen. Reading/browsing web is what this tablet is best suited for, and this is what I intended.

Drawing: Using downloadable drawing apps on this tablet isn‚Äôt much good, because there‚Äôs noticeable lag when you paint/draw anything with your finger or a stylus-pen. However, it has its own pen-mode which can be activated by just swiping from mid-right edge. This mode, being an OS-function, is much more responsive and writing/drawing feels more natural. Google Keyboard‚Äôs handwriting mode works well and response is fast. Marking PDFs in Adobe Acrobat works like a charm, though you might want to buy a good quality stylus for that. Again, I cannot stress more about the fact that this tablet is meant for reading books.

2. Sound/Recording:
The two speakers placed on two sides give very good stereo separation, and the Dolby Audio modes make watching Movies/TV shows a treat on tablet speakers without using headphones. Don't expect heavy bass or loudness cause they're just tablet speakers, after all. There are tablets out there with much louder sound levels. Here, the sound is just loud enough for watching stuff with a ceiling fan on in your room in noisy daytime - Yes, they're good enough, all things considered. But any more noise and the speakers can‚Äôt keep up. At night, when everything is quite outside, they work much better.
Having dual mics and active noise cancellation is great for video/voice calls, though I'll be using headphones for calls so this feature won't get used much.

3. Design: It's got a good, sturdy metal-finish body with narrow bezels around the screen. The lock button is textured and feels nice. USB-C works well, and it has those ""Pogo"" connectors on side (or on bottom if you‚Äôre holding it in landscape mode), which are Lenovo's own connector points to attach keyboard/accessories. Good for future, I guess? Although I‚Äôm skeptical if I‚Äôll ever use them. If you‚Äôre buying a 20K tablet, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre going to invest in expensive add-on accessories for this. But if you have something like Alexa docking station, it will fit right in.

Back side has a small camera bump which will make you feel like you‚Äôre going to damage the lens or something if you place it on a hard table, but the camera isn't any good to begin with so I wouldn't worry about that at all. Another thing: There's no screen protector included (I never use screen protectors on my devices anyway), and there's no cover as well. But it‚Äôs made of sturdy stuff and I‚Äôve been handling it rough for about a month and it‚Äôs doing great so far. Still, it is good idea to buy a cover/protector because you cannot escape screen-scratches in long term use.

4. Performance and Connectivity:
If you're looking for a tablet for book reading, multi-tasking, split-screen usage, multi-tab web browsing, watching 1080p videos on YouTube/Netflix, playing videos (upto 10bit-HEVC/x265 1080p) in MX Player, or some light Snapseed/Photoshop Express editing, Office applications like MS Word, Powerpoint or play games like Clash of Clans/PUBG casually... Then you're all set. 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, Mediatek 2.3+1.8GHz CPU and 128GB eMMC storage are enough. The hardware is mediocre and outdated but it works good enough.
Playing PUBG/Call of Duty at low settings will give you good performance just like any phone with 4GB RAM (with stereo audio without headphones). A good feature of having mediocre hardware is that it doesn't get very hot even after heavy use for a long time.

But if you demand anything more (High graphics settings, x264 or x265 4K videos, fast video encoding), then this won't do it. Gaming frame rates slow down to unplayable levels on high graphics settings and 4K videos stutter a lot during playback in both native player and MX player. Even 1080p videos, when heavily compressed in HEVC-x265 format have frame drops when playing back some intense, detailed action scenes.
Why? Because LPDDR 4 RAM and PowerVR 8320 are 2017-level hardware. That's probably why this tablet doesn't cost too much. You'll have to spend more money for powerful tablets if hardcore gaming and ultra-high performance is what you're looking for. By spending about Rs.9,000/- more you can get the base version of an iPad which is like 20 times faster, but more on that later.

It supports 4G SIM, Bluetooth 5.0, all the bells and whistles. No infrared though. It can simultaneously connect to a Wifi and work as hotspot router, and even has 5GHz mode for hotspot (which comes in handy when casting to an external display because 5GHz gives very minimal lag).
Wifi hotspot has extra features, like you can block devices even if they have your hotspot password, you can limit the number of devices than can connect to your tablet (from 2 to 10), and you can see the names and software of all the connected/blocked devices. So that gives you full router-like control over your wifi hotspot which is a good feature.

5. Battery:
This is a weird area ‚Äì it all depends on brightness. On one hand, this gives enough battery time to read books for many hours with Read Mode turned on. You can turn the Read Mode off and watch HD movies for like 4-5 hours and still have enough battery left to read/browse/work for 2-3 hours. And all that is with Auto-Brightness turned on and using tablet indoors.
With regular usage of browsing/reading, watching Full-HD Youtube and ample standby time in between, this tablet easily lasts 24 hours before it needs charging.
For networking, I charged it to 100% and inserted a BSNL SIM with limitless 3G data plan and used the tablet as Hotspot, I surfed the internet on computer using its hotspot all day, downloaded/uploaded about 24GB of data: Yes, BSNL is only mobile company that gives 3G plans with no speed limit no daily data limit. Screen was kept locked, only using it occasionally. At the end of the day it had a whopping 55% battery left after such a long usage of continuous 3G+Wifi hotspot at internet speeds of about 1.3 MB/sec. I liked it so much that I‚Äôve made this default hotspot for my PC usage.

But, if you turn off Auto-Brightness and increase the brightness to 100% (or use the tablet in bright light/daylight), battery backup gets cut down in half. Watching a 90-minute long 1080p-10bit-x265 video on full brightness will bring the battery from 98% to 59%. I guess the large backlit LCD display running at full brightness takes a LOT of power, so keep the brightness low with Blue filter on and it will last a lot longer.

It doesn't support fast-charging. Even when I used my MI-18W fast-charger, the battery charged at same, slow rate - about 2.5 to 3 hours from 1% to 100% - but charger itself got heated up. You should probably use its own charger and be content with what you get instead of trying incompatible chargers and damaging the battery.

6. Camera/Face Unlock:
Only thing the cameras are good for is videocalling. Other than that, they're pretty much useless. Not much details in the 8/5MP cameras. Even face unlock doesn't work well in dim-lit rooms/indoors/dark conditions (and indoor/dark conditions are where the tablet works best, so it's a bad tradeoff). Don't get me wrong, in well-lit conditions the face unlock works fine, even when you shave your beard or put on glasses. But in dark, its own screen light isn't bright enough to detect your face. A workaround is using a very white-ish/snowy wallpaper as your lockscreen and keep brightness at max ‚Äì that will shine enough light on your face to unlock screen in complete darkness.

6. OS: It is a pure Android 9.0 with Feb 2020 patch so it's as latest as Android Pie can get. It doesn't come with any customized UI, pre-installed adware, or useless apps/games that cannot be uninstalled ‚Äì It has none of those things and that makes this tablet a very good product right out of box. You get an unhampered Android OS without any useless overlays using your storage/RAM. It doesn't have any OS restrictions so you can install your own Home/Launcher app, change themes, keyboards, navigation style, whatever.

Android 10 has been officially released via OTA upgrade for this tablet and it works great! Performance has become much better, universal dark theme is a welcome feature. There are no lags whatsoever after using Android 10 on this for about a month.
Although, after upgrading to Android 10, you no longer have control over who can and cannot connect to you Wifi Hotspot, you cannot limit number of users and you cannot even see the names of the devices connected to you tablet's Wifi hotspot. This bugged me.

Attaching a wireless keyboard/mouse effectively turns the tablet into a complete PC, with a taskbar. Using PC/Productivity mode to write documents, create presentations and chat with people is just like having a mini laptop. Don‚Äôt expect Samsung Dex-like freedom, though. Still, you can enable ‚Äúforce resize‚Äù option in developer mode and every app (including Instagram that doesn‚Äôt support split-screen) will work split-screen in landscape mode. Switching apps from taskbar is fast and there's no lag that I‚Äôve noticed so far.
Then again, I don't use bloatware apps or games and always keep very neat, minimum set of apps with lots of free space so maybe that's the reason this tablet works so smooth for me? Who knows.

7. Accessories: It doesn't come with any accessories, not even headphones. Buying official Lenovo covers/folio covers or alexa speakers with this tablet doesn't make much sense. For a 20K tablet, even a simple folio cover that costs around 1200/- seems too expensive. Buying an expensive stylus/pen is of no use too, because drawing apps lag.

But there are alternatives: You can buy a cheap 10-inch Keyboard case for just 500/-, and a simple stylus pen for 400/- if you wanna take notes on this. These two things kind of complete this tablet (see pics) and effectively turn it into a working laptop computer where you can type long documents and mark PDFs, do videocalls etc.
For better results, you can buy a Bluetooth keyboard case by HOM for INR 2300/-. It has good leather cover, laptop-like detachable wireless keyboard with chiclet-island buttons.

Overall:
It's not a bad product. It's very good at what it's supposed to do. But thinking of it as a high-performer will get you disappointed. It's a good reading/watching/working tablet with huge storage. Let me tell you why it is good:
In similar or lower price range, you'll get 10.1-inch or smaller 7-inch tablets with 720p or maybe 1080p resolution. and upto 2/3 GB RAM (gaming is out of question there even at low settings). You‚Äôll get only 16:9 ratio which is less wide than Lenovo. The others, including more expensive iPads have like 32/64GB stroages with only Wi-Fi and no 3G/4G SIM, or maybe 3G/4G SIM for Internet only and no voice calling. You may get only one speaker, or two speakers sitting on the same side, Android support with up to Android 8.0, and they all come with custom UI, pre-installed useless malware that can't be uninstalled.

This tablet has a bigger 10.3-inch full-HD IPS screen, wider 16:10 portrait ratio, 4GB RAM, proper phone-like 4G SIM with calling support, a fast enough CPU, 128 GB storage with SD-card support, USB Type-C, dual stereo speakers with dual mics, Malware-free Pure Android 10, and enough capacity to play all android games on medium/low settings. There's not a single tablet in this price range that can give you all this together. This is by far cheapest 128GB tablet, cheapest 10.3-inch tablet and cheapest 4GB RAM tablet, and cheapest Android 10 tablet.
There are few things they could have done better - 1440p or AMOLED display, IR-face unlock, better battery, faster GPU. But asking for these things at 20K price seems pointless.
They could have given a fingerprint scanner and fast-charging though ‚Äì Those features are common in even the cheapest phones nowadays. This is the only reason I‚Äôm giving it a 4-star rating instead of 5.

Alternatives/Comparisons:
1. Going below 20K:
a) If you go a little low on the budget by even Rs.1000/-, the 19K tablets' specs drop down to 3GB RAM and 32GB storage e.g. IRA, DOMO etc which aren't even reliable brands.
b) Going as low as 15K will get you even lesser 2GB RAM, 16/32GB storage, slower CPU/GPU and no SIM support. e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tab A, Huawei Mediapad etc. If you're on budget and don't wanna spend 20K, those are good enough options.
c) Going further below will degrade the specs even more, and reduce screen size down to 8-inches. e.g. Alcatel 3T, Lenovo M8, Lenovo M10, Galaxy Tab A 8-inch and so on.

2. Going up 20K:
a) iPad 10.2-inch has larger 4:3 screen area, high-res Retina display, much faster CPU/GPU and incredible performance. For 30K, this is next-best option. Its downsides: you get only 32GB storage with no SD-card support, no SIM/calling support, very expensive accessories and limited customization. If your concern is only performance and you don't need large storage or phone calling, better go for it because its performance is unmatched in comparison to this Lenovo tab.
b) Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite: Larger display, Louder audio, S-pen included (albeit a fragile one), SD-card support, 4GB RAM, faster performance, larger battery. For 28K, this is also a good option. Downside: Again, no SIM/calling, lesser 64GB storage.

So, there you go. Best value for money in this price range.",4
1051,"Pros-
1) 4GB RAM+ 128 GB storage for 20k Tab is the first in its segment
2) Thin bezels and FHD display makes the tablet future proof.
3) Best device for reading and entertainment with sufficient battery life
4) No bloatware, almost clean android experience
5) Decent audio output.

Cons-
1) Device is a bit slow, credits to its outdated 2017 year processor and useless graphic card.
2) The glass is not Corning gorilla and there are currently no accessories in indian market (screen guard or case) Be afraid!! Very afraid!!
3) Facial recognition is out of question. Doesn't work 90% of the time.
4) Brightness is not enough ~350 nits for reading in outdoor environment

Conclusion:
If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet with good display, storage, kids learning go for it.
Don't expect ipad kind of performance while gaming (PUBG, COD) however it manages to run in low graphic settings.
Over all LENOVO tab M10 FHD plus deserves 4.0 rating.",4
1052,"The tablet is good but I need help with the stylus.
The stylus is marked as Active pen 3 , but I couldn‚Äôt find out anything about it on the internet. Not even sure if Lenovo launched the active pen 3.
Need some help to figure the stylus out",4
1053,"1. Great display
2. No lags
3. Clean UI
4. Good for Multi-tasking
5. Not for gaming (no tablet in this price range is suitable for gaming)
6. Speaker Volume is a bit on the lower side
7. 128GB storage and 4GB ram- cherries on top

*Hope there will be an update for Android 10.

If you compare this with SAMSUNG A 10.1 priced at 15k, the extra 5k you'll be paying for this tablet is totally worth it as you get 4GB of ram and double the storage (128GB) compared to 2GB RAM (500mb actually available) and 64GB ROM. Furthermore, thinner bezels and a clean stock android experience add on to the margins in terms of overall experience.

In a nutshell, it's the best tablet in this price range. Though there are some compromises to be made as for the speakers and battery life which are not so bad tbh but we can't complaint at this price point.

Hope this helps :)",4

Reviewing after 15 days Used.

You're getting a 10.3-inch 1920x1200 display with 128GB storage - for Just 20k INR.

Analysis:

1. Display:
It is a brilliant, IPS panel with very good colors, allows very wide viewing with only minimal color change over extreme angles, and a 16:10 full-HD ratio. It's bigger than most tablets and even iPads (they are all 10.1 inches while this is 10.3). In Portrait mode it is as wide as two Redmi Note 8 screens side by side - which makes it a perfect choice for reading and browsing. Brightness isn't the highest i've seen, but it has OK sunlight readability in max brightness if you're planning on reading/surfing; but Movies/videos are best watched indoors.
It has a 'Productivity Mode' under display settings which turns the bottom Navigation bar into PC/Mac-like Taskbar, where are all your open apps appear as icons and can be opened/closed directly without going into overview mode, and the home/back/task navigation buttons are pushed to corner to be used with a single thumb.
2. Design: It's a good, sturdy, metal-finish body with very narrow bezels around screen. The volume/lock buttons are textured which gives good feel to use them. USB-C is good to have, and it also has those things called ""Pogo"" connectors on side, which are Lenovo's own connector points to attache keyboard/accessories.

3. Performance:
If you're looking for book reading, multi-tasking, split-screen usage, multi-tab web browsing, watching 1080p videos on YouTube/Netflix, playing 10bit-HEVC/x265 1080p videos in MX Player, or some light Snapseed/Photoshop editing, office applications like MS Word, Powerpoint or play games like Clash of Clans... Then you're all set. 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, Mediatek 2.3/1.8GHz CPU and 128GB eMMC storage are enough.
Even playing PUBG/Call of Duty at low settings will give you very good performance just like any phone with 4GB RAM (with awesome audio without headphones).
Another good feature of having mediocre hardware is that it doesn't get very hot even after heavy use of whatever it can handle for long time.
ardware. That's why this tablet doesn't cost twice its price. You'll have to sp

4. Battery:
This is a weird area. On one hand, this gives enough battery time to read books for many hours with Auto-Brightness + Read Mode turned on. You can even turn the Read Mode/Blue filter off and watch HD movies for like 4-5 hours and still have enough battery left to read/browse/work for 2-3 hours. And all that is with Auto-Brightness turned on and using tablet indoors.
For networking, I charged it to 100% and inserted a BSNL SIM with limitless 3G data plan and used the tablet as Hotspot, I surfed the internet on computer using its hotspot all day, downloaded/uploaded about 14GB of data, Watched YouTube etc. Yes, BSNL is only mobile company that gives 3G plans with no speed limit no daily data limit. Only drawback is they don't give ultra-fast 4G, but 3G speed of 1.2 MB/sec is more than enough. Screen was kept locked, only using it occasionally. At the end of the day it had a whopping 55% battery left after such a long usage of continuous 3G+Wifi hotspot.

But, if you turn off Blue Filter and increase the brightness to 100% (or use the tablet in bright light/daylight), battery times gets cut down in half. Just watching a 1-hour long 1080p-10bit-x265 video will bring the battery from 98% down to 59%. I guess the large backlit LCD display running at full brightness takes a LOT of battery, so keep the brightness low with Blue filter on and it will last much, much longer.

Also, They didn't give a fast-charger in the box, and even when I used my own fast-charger, the battery charges at same, slow rate - about 2.5 to 3 hours from 1% to 100%. So you should always use it's own charger and be content with what you get instead of trying incompatible chargers and damaging the battery/hardware.

5. Camera/Face Unlock:
Only thing the cameras are good for is video calling and showing the people what's in front of tablet and behind over the internet. Other than that, they're pretty much useless. Not much details in the 8/5MP cameras. Even face unlock doesn't work well in dim-lit rooms/indoors/dark conditions (and indoor/dark conditions are where the tablet works best, so it's a bad tradeoff).

6. OS: It is a neat, pure Android 9.0 with Feb 2020 patch so it's as latest at Android Pie can get.

And it doesn't have any restrictions so you install your own Home/Launcher app, change themes, keyboards, navigation style whatever.
Android 10 might take very long to come for this so don't wait for updates. What it has works good enough.

OVERALL -
1. Great display -Bit laggy in beginning but very good now.
2. Great Speakers.
3. Clean UI
4. Good for Multi-tasking,Online Learning etc
5. Not for gaming (no tablet in this price range is suitable for gaming)
6. Speaker Volume good with Dolby.
7. 128GB storage and 4GB ram- cherries on top.
8. Camera‚Äôs very low usually for video calling only.

This tablet has a huge, 10.3-inch full-HD IPS screen, 4GB RAM, proper phone-like single 4G SIM support, 128 GB storage with SD-card support, USB Type-C, dual stereo speakers with dual mics, Malware-free Pure Android 9, and capacity to play games on high framerates with low settings.

There's not a single tablet in this price range that can give you all this together.
Best in its Price Range. Better than Samsung Tab 10.1 .",4
1057,"Well! After 3 more years of same M Series Tab finally Lenovo came out with updated model and its really amazing. Amazon delivery is really fast. Updating after 1 week use:

Pros:-
1. Talking about the device in this Price range, Mediatek Helio P22 does a great job. Not a High end Processor but enough to keep you entertained. Multitasking is smooth.

2. The display is amazing. It's an IPS LCD Panel but it doesn't disappoints. Colours, Saturation and Viewing Angles are good. Watched 1080p Blueray Videos and surprised. Works really great.

3. I am not a heavy gamer. Don't go for negative reviews about gaming. I have played Asphalt 9, Pubg( in med. Settings) and COD. High settings didn't supprted but surprisingly no lag at all in med. Setting.

4. Office working Apps like Office, Photoshop and even I edited videos. Works totally fine. Taking bit time to reload ( High end video editing apps) but once opened no lag at all.

Cons:-
1. Well In this price segment you can't expect much but comparing directly to its competitors Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite, It should have atleast a fast charger support along with 7000 mah battery. Though I have watched 2 movies in medium brightness with Eye care mode on from 100% it went down to 35%. Decent Battery not great.

2. Device seems to be a bit heavy and absence of fingerprint scanner is really annoying. Always have to give pattern.

Overall, In this price Range, You will get FHD display with so narrow bazels gives you an amazing experience. It's really worth every penny of it. In this price segment Best Tab.",4
1058,"Tablet is good for studets and for some office purpose.

More intersting thing observed that Amazon app not compatable in this tablet .

I have not see case for this tablet in the Amazon or other sites.",4

About Tab:
Screen: Screen size good enough to learn or watch videos online , Screen brightness is good indoor but not that good for outdoor.You have keep full bright while watching videos or online class which actually drains battery faster .Touch is good .
Sound: Sound is fantastic with speakers provided at both side .Dolby Atmos is superb.
Processing:Tab works smoothly with 4 gb or ram but sometimes a lil lag in operations which is not common .Tried drawing apps and it works well , Overall it's good .
Body: Well built body with metal back cover and overall tab looks good in design .

Gaming : If you are buying it for gaming better try other options as processing of games are quite slower which is visible while playing .

Note : Hope one day all these gadgets will be manufactured in India someday as this is made in china and doesn't looks good ""made in china "" behind tab .",4

1. Pen pressure is good working.
2. In Display drawing option is nice one
Bad

2. Battery performance is bad (maximum 5hr with internet)
3. Pen and tab need to keep separately , no attaching option",4
1061,"I bought the 2GB version after a thorough research and analysis of my expected use case.

Tldr: I would recommend this for students who want to use it as an accessory to studying but not as a primary tool simply because it is just to laggy to do anything on, if you are looking at pages all day long the lag is negligible but when start swapping between apps and doing any normal task you will feel the lagging.
It is cheap for a reason, if you are a student who wants to use it to read pdf while studying and exclusively for that purpose to for it, if you want to do anything else on this tablet get the 4gb.
I use multiple reading app with integrated dictionary, formulae, charts making studying fun and effective.

FOR READING:
I use it exclusively for reading and nothing else, I was going for a Kindle but realised I did not own a tablet.
Next thing will be a Kindle but I am enjoying reading on this tablet, the screen is big and there is a grayscale option which makes the screen b/w and an absolute treat to read on. I didn't think it would be this easy to move from books to a tablet but some features on the tablet like grayscale, eye care, do not disturb among others make this tablet great for use as a reader.
I would recommend this for student who want to use it as an accessory to studying but not as a primary tool simply because it is just to laghu to do anything on, if you are looking at pages all day long the lag is negligible but when start swapping between apps and doing any normal task you will feel the lagging.
It is cheap for a reason, of you are a student who wants to use it to read pdf while studying and exclusively for that purpose to for it, if you want to do anything else on this tablet get the 4gb.

FOR Multitasking or normal tablet use:
Look elsewhere the 2gb variant even though cheap is too laggy for most people, even when downloading books or taking screenshots I can see the tablet struggle. I use it exclusively for reading for I don't mind the temporary lagging.
I would say this is essentially unusable for most things and one should look at getting the 4GB variant.

FOR GAMING/MULTITASKING:
The 2gb variant is absolutely not for gaming, most games won't even load.

Final thoughts: The price of the tablet considering the massive screen and additional functionality made it a bargain for me with my limited use case. The screen is 1920x1200, 2 gb isn't enough to drive that.
The screen and touch response is fine as expected from tech that has recieved many refinements, it has reached the point where it is rarely a point of concern.
Absolutely enjoying reading on this thing, I have already read 3 books, a total of 900-1000 pages.",4
1062,"(Will update experience) This is really good tablet I bought after some cheap chinese and desi(bhartiya) Shxxy Notion Ink (dupes and no ass - after sales service).

Observations uptill now (11-02-2021):

- Negative: ( I am going to check for os/firware updates, if any)

(1) Just one thing I observed it sometimes vibrates and reboots on its own without any issues.
(2) Touch screen response could be better.(this may be application issue - instagram)

- Positive:

(1) Good touch screen response (other than what I mentioned above)
(2) Camera: haven't taken any pics yet.
(3)",4
1063,"Pros-
1) 4GB RAM+ 128 GB storage for 20k Tab is the first in its segment
2) Thin bezels and FHD display makes the tablet future proof.
3) Best device for reading and entertainment with sufficient battery life
4) No bloatware, almost clean android experience
5) Decent audio output.

Cons-
1) Device is a bit slow, credits to its outdated 2017 year processor and useless graphic card.
2) The glass is not Corning gorilla.
3) Facial recognition is out of question. Doesn't work 90% of the time.
4) Brightness is not enough ~350 nits for reading in outdoor environment

Conclusion:
If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet with good display, storage, kids learning go for it.
Don't expect ipad kind of performance while gaming however it manages to run in low graphic settings.",4
1064,"I like the screen size which is 10.3 in, big enough size. Second the specification are enough for normal operations unless one needs higher spects for gaming, where it may be a little under spect. Third, LTE Sim slot provided at this price point, which is simply a great offer. The touch screen is very intuitive and has a great response. The color response is truly dynamic. The screen bajels are thin which add to the overall look of the tablet. Overall it's been a good buy, espcially for my kids, who need a tab for thier routine zoom/Google meet online classes in these times of corona pandemic. The only downside is the audio which could have been better, the volume is kind of low even by mobile phone comparison and the audio could have been a little bit more beefier, rather than mostly shrills, which is usually the case.",4
1065,"The first one I got was faulty; within couple of days, the screen had vertical lines and luckily the replacement period was not over yet, hence I got the replacement without any hassle, otherwise I would have ended up running around to get the screen replaced.
I have bought this for my son to take his online class and completing homework if it is directly in school website and also to play his favourite games; the camera resolution front and back are good, the clarity for video calls using zoom is good. There is no lag while playing racing games or arcade games; high end games not sure how it will behave.
The tablet is not that heavy, so kids can easily carry around without any hassle; and the screen size is 10 inch so you can see more and easy to use; not too much stress on the eyes.
Overall a good product, since the first one I received went faulty within couple of days, I am not sure how long the second one will last",4
1066,"Good packaging.
Speed - Good with the 8gb RAM
Storage - 128 gb. Good for kids school work.
Games - Not suggested. Holds good for office and School.
Looks - Decent.
Weight - Can be tough for a kid to hold with one hand. And also difficult for Adults to hold for more than 10 mins. Would need a good supporting cover.
Graphics - Not for games. But for all the office, home, school purpose is good. Movies and Videos can be watched in HD.
Camera - ok. Not so great but for clicking u have a phone and fkr viewing this Tab is good.",4

Rest for Kids uses and watching on OTT flatform this is a good buy.",4
1069,"I use this tablet as a second screen for my desktop using TwomonSe app. It works great with just a slight lag which you wont notice much. Other than that I just use it for some normal browsing and watching video on youtube.
The screen is amazing
The speakers are okay but quite annoying in the higher frequencies and are not loud
I went with the 2GB variant so the ram management is not good at all. Go for the 4GB variant if you want it to be your primary device.
But apart from al these, it serves my purpose as an amazing touch second screen for my PC which makes my life easier.",4

Only bit of cons I see was screen hd quality could have improved as some full hd 1080p Vedios seem to be downscaled to normal hd 720p even using the best hd settings in Amazon prime. Initially I thought this is a buffering issue but it stayed the same but buffering and playback was no issue due to decent processor so I got used to it. However didn't experience this issue with other apps like YouTube. I am not a gamer so can't comment on the gaming performance but as per some reasearch it seems to perform well. So overall this a decent product from lenevo.",4

Build quality is Very nice.",4
1073,"Tab is okay and functioned in the beginning. After a week, it started showing technical glitches. While in operation, it would suddenly go off and boot itself for 3 or 4 times daily. It happened four days consecutively. We updated the system files and the issue disappeared for more than a week. But It came back today 23/08/2021 and also hanging issues while video streaming in whatsapp. Amazon was contacted who directed us to contact Lenovo on their toll free number. We are yet to contact them.

Tablet supports voice call and single 4g sim also. Battery is good with 5 to 7 hrs of its backup. It consumes 2 hrs in charging. Amazon did not provide smart dock charging system with stand at Rs. 19999 while Flip kart provides it at Rs 20999. I have a complaint with Amazon that two scratches showing on screens it was seen after 10 days replacement time over. So I'm little disappoint. One thing i.e. Ms-office can't use without subscription.",4

PROS:
- Good build quality. As expected from Lenovo devices, the tablet is of a great build.
- Responsive touch screen with accurate color reproduction.

CONS:
- Very poor chip performance. Top end games cannot be played on this device. Screen stutters a lot. GPU is extremely poor.
- No software support. According to the Lenovo website, this device is eligible for only 1 year of updates. Thus, you will be stuck with Android 10. There were no security updates as well after completion of 1 year.
- Cannot stream HDR content without lags due to poor GPU performance.",4
1077,"First piece, I too faced the screen issue with lines. I was lucky that it happened on day one and the tab was replaced. Since then no issue with the new piece. It's value for money, pen is good. S6 lite may be having better pen, but may not justify additional 10k. The s6 lite wifi could be a better option if you can manage without lte.",4
1078,"I am using it for online classes and based on usage it is a great value for money product with good configurations. Screen size and quality is perfect for your little one's eye's. Nice speakers with good sound output. With 4GB/128GB RAM/ROM combination it helps you to easily handle duties for online classes.
Battery is good enough to hold for 6-7 hrs. There is no quick charge.",4

I purchased it in around 20,000 and comparing it with samsung or apple tabs, it was within my range and performance is satisfactory. Speaker vooume is also awesome. Battery life is something I am little disappointed, otherwise it is really good tab within this price range.",4

I bought for my daughter to attend online class.
It's ok. No issues. Everything going good. Nothing great that we can expect for the price ‚Çπ.13999.
Like :
1. No system hang, heating issues.
2. Battery is ok. For Normal standby - 2 days. Continuous use with 4G data & video ( online classes) - 8 Hrs. But if turn ON hotspot, then 6 to 7Hrs. Obviously it is expected.
Dislikes :
1. Sound quality. Really pathetic. Not clear audio kind of Cracking sound. No issues for online classes as it is only speech. But songs it's not good.
2. Important - when turn ON both Bluetooth and Hotspot, then internet network in other devices which uses hotspot is occasionally disconnected or no network. Couldn't attend classes with Bluetooth headphone with hotspot. Serious issue. Not sure about other devices. Kindly check.",4

1085,"You can't expect perfect tab in this price range. But this one is a near to perfect item given the price. Battery back up is good, 8-9 hrs of continuous video play after full charge. Don't expect much from camera quality. Touch is smooth, voice quality is good. Face recognition feature nees improvement for sure. Also, charger comes with the tab is not fast charger and takes around 3 hrs to charge from 0 to 100%.

 I am writing this review after 4months of usage.

I bought this tablet on Aug-14.honestly i am saying

1.i never got version upgrade /update.
2.the GUI is very low

The tablet is not physically damaged as you can see in the video. It starts to appear glitching flashes and horizontal and vertical lines randomly. I know why it is happening because of the poor screen quality. The tablet still is in warranty. So kindly please provide me a refund/replacement.

I never thought Appario Retail Private Ltd will sell this low quality tablets. I contact the seller more than 10times. No one is picking up my call and i contacted the Amazon

They asking me to contact the seller.

I dont know what to do

So please resolve my issue

Still i have the price tag, box, charger all materials as new",4

Absolutely no option of fast charging even if you use a 20w fast charger.

Good for kids online stuff but keep in mind the very very very poor battery performance",4

Third and finally It's pen this tablet doesn't support any active pen so the pen given with this is nothing but a touch stylus nothing else ,

The graphics of the game are not that special but are also very good and not so bad Everything was fine, but when I unboxed it, I saw that inside which is scratched?
When I opened the box, there is a slight stain on the back side. As you can also see, it is not good to stain a new product. It does not look good and looks a bit bad, so I had complained a little about this, so after the complaint, the order came after the replacement. Patori place was not found, because of customer care mistake, they did not take the complaint properly and sent some other photo instead of my scratch photo. Due to which the Amazon delivery dealer refused to take that product and did not take it from that increase. After that I tried refund to give me another one but it didn't happen then they said that I will be refunded the money. Butt said that the second will not be replaced again, so when did I say okay, it will happen. Otherwise, the time of the 4th was given after that. After that the time of 8th will go again. Then after a long time, I placed the order on 28th September and did not come on 29th. It came and not even after that.

Few things I noticed after 4 days of use -
1) Battery lasts for about a day
2) Camera quality isn't good but ok for video calling
3) I don't play games or watch too much movies so can't comment on that.
4) I bought it mainly for study purpose, so I needed to write on tablet to make notes. The response of pen provided with this tablet is little slow but still ok if you write slow.

The tablet turn off automatically sometimes for no reason. There is some bug in the software or hardware. It really gets annoying sometimes.

The tablet is ok but for 20K, a little better experience is expected.

It's upto user perspective.
But battery management is awesome. Screen resolution is slightly lesser (1920 X 1200p) then full HD so you can seal black bar's in top bottom when watching and streaming video online.

Pros. Battery,speaker,screen watching videos and movies.
Wi-Fi connectivity is awesome. No lag.
4GB RAM and 128 GB Storage for this price is very good.
No heating issues even while charging in videos are Running.
Google Home Support is awesome.

2. Office emails on GMAIL.
3. Viewing PDF documents.
4. Office docs on Google Drive

I also got myself a Bluetooth keyboard to work with the tablet. Over the last two weeks I realised that I am using the laptop less and less.
I get a battery life of around a day with a screen time of around 3 hours with 80% brightness. I have a JIO sim for Internet which is on VOLTE. If I use home WiFi then the battery life is greater by around an hour or so.

The screen size is big and bright. The resolution is less which is a good thing we don‚Äôt need a very high resolution for normal use and the battery life and cpu performance is better with this optimum resolution

 Product is pretty good. I guess if you are not an artist this tab and pen would work for any normal work. Supports palm rejection well.

I rejected several low-end brands. The choice eventually boiled down to Lenovo versus Samsung. Amazon had a better deal on the Lenovo so that helped me finalize my decision.

No regrets! This is an excellent tablet at this price. Here are the highlights:

Design: Very sleek, very smart!

Usability: Intuitive navigation with the all-too-familiar Google interface.

Display Quality: Bright, crisp and easy to read.

Sound: Pretty loud - which makes it a great device for watching YouTube videos and movies.

Speed: Good - so far, no buffering or hang mode issues.

Build: Excellent - feels like a premium product. Does not have a ""plastic-y"" feel at all.

Battery: Good, really good.

Bottom Line: Overall, based on multiple parameters, this has (so far) been a very good choice. I got the tablet at a special offer price of INR 14,999/- and this made the deal sweeter!",4

I had Samsung m30s ,intially it worked like butter but after 1year it hangs too much
*Four year same happened with my samsung galaxy J2

4.YOU MAY BE CONFUSED THAT SAMSUNG HAS BIGGER BATTERY ,BUT BELIEVE ME THIS TAB ALTHOUGH HAS 5100MAH BATTERY BUT IT LAST FOR FULL 1DAY ON HEAVY USEAGE

 Let's keep it simple.
Pros:
1) best is battery backup. Gives screen time more than 1.6 day. Which is brilliant.(see image)
2) screen quality is great. The eye protection works well. And the dark mode is awesome.
3) Navigation is great.
4) Dual Speakers supports Dolby Atmos.
5) type c charging port.
6) the tab is beautiful even to look at.

Pros ps: I mainly use this for my jee preparation and reading books(and sometimes movies). Before I used to use laptop which was bulky and consumed a lot of power. But this is perfect for anyone like me.

Cons:
1) Speakers could have been better. It's loud for a room but still if it can be in cons.....
2) If you buy this for gaming you will be ruined. This tab(2gb) cannot support games. It will shut down as soon as you open it.
3) For the price range cameras are fine.
4) if you are a heavy user then go for the 4gb variant. As I have stated earlier if you buy this only for small task then it does it's job fine.
5) there is a little lag.

Final ps: I am using this for 4 months now. And I can guarantee you that this is quite fine and value for money. The tab is well built. Amazon also delivers it in time.

Thanks lenevo and Amazon.",4
1129,"Writing review after usage of 30+ days.
Pros -
1. RAM 4GB, does not feel any lag, things work smooth
2. Internal memory is 128GB, so huge space to use.
3. CPU is also good with good clock speed n cores, so processing/instructions are fast.
4. 10 inches screen, perfect for attending calls on MS team or Zoom.
5. Speaker volume is good, one can take calls via pad speakers.
6. I got in 17k, so it was a best deal.
7. Not played games so can't say on that front.

Cons -
1. Didn't find as such. Ya but just to write, it could be more sleeker.

Overall verdict, in all a good package and VFM.",4
1130,"After using it for a month, I am writing this review. I wanted a device to read a few things and I was confused between Kindle and a tablet. I purchased this finally. This tablet allows to me read from lot of sources like News Apps, Oreilly App and Kindle as well. I see it as an excellent alternative for Kindle.

Pros:
1. Screen is excellent for reading (actually its pretty large) and there are features that keeps your eyes comfortable for reading. I use it around 1-1.30 hour per day. Multiple news apps, Oreilly, Coursera and Youtube.

2. Good battery life. For my light reading and browsing, it easily lasts for 8-9 days for 1-1.30 hour per day usage.

3. Dolby Audio - Audio is excellent in both earphones and speaker mode. Although I don't use audio much, I tried out and it was good!

Cons:
1. I saw many reviews before buying and some of them had a screen issue within a week. I am not sure if its a seller issue or the customer was not careful, but anyway my biggest fear is the screen issue. Its not Gorilla glass, so I am being very careful even after a month.",4
1131,"This tab was beyond my expectation. Everything is good about this my child uses this for online classes. The display could've been a little better and brighter, however it doesn't matter. The Active pen 3 is no nonsense, just load with battery and use it right away. Hope to use for couple of weeks and order one more.",4
1132,"Nothing to complain about, except that the charging cable supplied is not very long.and the front facing camera is average at best. Otherwise, It is in fact an awesome tablet that performs very well even with multiple apps or browser windows open. The form factor and size (10.3 inches) makes it slightly large for one handed operation though. If you want to use it like a phone, it is better to go for an 8 inch.",4

Absolutely value for money.",4
1134,"Bought the product 12.5k with a old samsungy galaxy 6 mobile exchange. it's screen response it mildly sluggish. Heavy. Have to buy screen guard.. memory and cover seperately...2k. Using it carefully we can keep it for another 3years I guess.

Other than that...it's a worthy product. U won't regret it. Am happy. Satisfying.",4
1135,"This is a good tablet for the price you pay. Unfortunately the software is the worst I have seen in recent years. Because there is optimization you a lag in most of the animations. If lenovo decided not to include the a biometric login, they should have optimised face detection, becuase face detection on this device is pre historic. This could be great tablet if lenovo can optimise the current software with an update. Budget phones which are less than 10k have better software.",4
1136,"For the money it's a superb device. My use for it restricted to word and watching movies. Yes the processor might be old, but for just entertainment and basic office work it's got enough firepower. The feel of the tablet is great, it feels premium to hold, fhd screen works great and touch sensitivity is very good too. I was frankly advised not go for it and spend more on an S6 lite or ipad. But at this price, it's impossible to get another calling tablet with 4 gigs and 128 gb. It's just unbeatable value with performance to match it's price.",4
1137,"A masterpiece by lenovo. I have been using this product for more than 10 days and have yet not faced any problem. The battery doesn't give enough backup but in 20K the overall product is quite awesome.
And thanks to Amazon delivery for quickly getting it to me.",4
1138,"Has a great display. Watching movies on Netflix or logging into online meetings experience is excellent since the display is good and dual speakers with Dolby Atmos gives excellent effect. For other general usage also, performance is more than adequate.
The processing speed is decent and the 32GB memory allows you ample space to store large files
Overall, it is definitely recommended at this price point, it won't disappoint on any aspect.",4
1139,Brought on 31st July 2020 and excellent product with 4GB Ram and 128GB with 10.3 inch display is amazing and with this price you won‚Äôt get the tab. Please go and grab. No need to check for Samsung or iPhone,4
1140,I needed a tab for study purpose and extensive reading. This is the best deal. Battery lasts upto 2-3 days for my usage (I'm not a gamer). If I wouldn't have found this product I would have gone for ipad 7th gen. But I'm glad that I stumbled upon this product. It delivers.,4
1141,"What more can be expected at such price!
Resolution is perfect. Screen size is appreciable. Battery is abit low capacity. Should have been minimum 7000mAh. Performance is overall good. Most attracting feature is the Dolby dual sound system. I do appreciate most people won't use a tablet's camera often. Just the selfie cam may be used once. So I don't comment for camera.",4
1142,"Tab is working fine without any issue, already upgraded with android 10. More are less similar to other reviews on positive side.
1. Bigger screen, if use with external split screen app, you can use it parallel during presentation/meeting
2. Sim card support
3. Phone dialer to make calls like mobile
Missing info or Good to have:
1. Availability of Native apps or various apps from lenovo itself.
2. Active Pen configuration, related apps
3. Photo album/gallery app
4. Split screen/multi screen functionality
5. Though have phone dialer, but no ringtone configuration etc, you can not expect it or work like mobile phone dialer or call related configuration
6. There is no clear doc/help information, whether tab can be used for phone calls.

At last, though it has many missing info or good to have list, the same is applicable for other tabs also.",4

1146,"Writing this review after using a month and half.
Mind-blowing gadget , at this price uou won't get so much features , no lag , no problem in screen quality or speaker.
Battery backup is an issue , but if you will get adapt after some times. Sound quality is awesome, it's clear and loud . Never played PUBG on it but i am sure it won't lag. 128 GB ROM does its work . Best tablet for study and entertainment purpose.....",4
1147,"I wanted something bigger than a phone for school work but laptops were too complex for kids in 4-5th standard.

Thankfully, this tablet was as easy as using the phone for kids.

They have been productive and once a while youtube doesn't hurt.

Get a screen cover and protective glass just be on the safe side. Hoping it will last 3-4 years.",4
1148,"I bought it so that I could read pdf books comfortably. 10 inch is a must if you want to read digital books. Serves the purpose of a laptop with features of a smartphone. 2+ GHz processor, 4 Gb ram and 128 Gb internal storage with FHD screen of 10+ inches. Bigger screen is certainly better. Can work as a laptop if you add a bluetooth mouse and keyboard to it. A smartphone can never compete with a tablet, where it's use as a cheap computer is considered. This product certainly adds to the shine of brand LENOVO.
Delivery was very fast, thanks to AMAZON and the SELLER.",4
1149,"The tab is good with bice touch response. I‚Äôve bought it for my kid‚Äôs classes. So far no lag, latency encountered. it‚Äôs been running smooth without any hanging issues but yeah the usage is not that extreme so can‚Äôt say how it would respond on heavy usage. But all in all it‚Äôs a good device",4
1150,"This has to a great tablet considering all aspects. Be it stock Android, decent storage & ram, decent processor as well. Camera is not at all great, but good enough to take pictures of important documents while using scanner app like Adobe.

Full HD resolution of 1920*1200 definitely helps while reading and other stuff.

Also if you are going to multi-task a lot, 4GB Ram variant should be the choice. The 2 GB one I got fails to multitask a bit and forgets the stored content on other apps.

The device was updated to Android 10, but would'nt hurt at all if we get the Android 11 update soon.

Battery feels like a beast as well.

So yeah a very good tablet device to have.",4
1151,"The tablet is sleek, responsive. Android 10. Value for money. Can't find a 4Gb/128Gb FHD,tablet this size for the price point. Can take microSXD card upto 256 Gb. Audio quality is good. Go for it.",4

So if you want to buy it for study purpose its best in its price range.",4
1158,I have purchased Lenevo tab FHD plus through Amazon and it is best and superb in this price segment I will recommend for this tablet.,4
1159,I thought that this tab is just for reading and for online classes .

1163,"A very good quality product and happy receive the product in time, I am fully satisfied with the product. On part of packaging as it is a costly product it should have been packed in another hardboard box instead of only in polythene bag.",4
1164,"For the price of 20K, you're getting a 10.3-inch 1920x1200 display with 128GB storage - it's as good as it can get in this price range.

Analysis:

1. Display:
It is a brilliant IPS panel with good color range. It allows pretty wide viewing with minimal color change over extreme angles, and has a 16:10 ratio. On paper, it is slightly bigger than most tablets - they are all 10.1 inches while this is 10.3. In the portrait mode it is as wide as two Redmi Note 8 Pro screens side by side - which makes it quite good for reading and browsing. A4 pages zoomed in to fit edges look great because of its extra width. Brightness isn't the highest I have seen. It has OK sunlight readability for outdoor reading/surfing. But movies/videos are best watched indoors because screen isn‚Äôt matte ‚Äì It‚Äôs quite reflective in medium brightness and you‚Äôll need a matte screen cover if you want to avoid those.
It has a 'Productivity Mode' under display settings which turns the bottom Navigation bar into PC/Mac-like Taskbar, where are all your open apps appear as icons and can be opened/closed directly without going into overview/task-manager mode. The home/back/task navigation buttons are pushed to corner, which can be used with a thumb. Neat. It will take some getting used to, but this mode works better for me than standard navigation gestures.

Note: If you're myopic/near-sighted and want to use tablet up close without using your glasses, you're going to see a lot of ‚Äòpixelation‚Äô in written text, 'cause this isn't a retina/UHD panel.
Eye protection mode works well and you can read books for a very long time without straining your eyes. This, along with Auto-Brightness, Reading Mode and big screen size make you feel like as if you're reading an actual paper book instead of watching it on screen. Reading/browsing web is what this tablet is best suited for, and this is what I intended.

Drawing: Using downloadable drawing apps on this tablet isn‚Äôt much good, because there‚Äôs noticeable lag when you paint/draw anything with your finger or a stylus-pen. However, it has its own pen-mode which can be activated by just swiping from mid-right edge. This mode, being an OS-function, is much more responsive and writing/drawing feels more natural. Google Keyboard‚Äôs handwriting mode works well and response is fast. Marking PDFs in Adobe Acrobat works like a charm, though you might want to buy a good quality stylus for that. Again, I cannot stress more about the fact that this tablet is meant for reading books.

2. Sound/Recording:
The two speakers placed on two sides give very good stereo separation, and the Dolby Audio modes make watching Movies/TV shows a treat on tablet speakers without using headphones. Don't expect heavy bass or loudness cause they're just tablet speakers, after all. There are tablets out there with much louder sound levels. Here, the sound is just loud enough for watching stuff with a ceiling fan on in your room in noisy daytime - Yes, they're good enough, all things considered. But any more noise and the speakers can‚Äôt keep up. At night, when everything is quite outside, they work much better.
Having dual mics and active noise cancellation is great for video/voice calls, though I'll be using headphones for calls so this feature won't get used much.

3. Design: It's got a good, sturdy metal-finish body with narrow bezels around the screen. The lock button is textured and feels nice. USB-C works well, and it has those ""Pogo"" connectors on side (or on bottom if you‚Äôre holding it in landscape mode), which are Lenovo's own connector points to attach keyboard/accessories. Good for future, I guess? Although I‚Äôm skeptical if I‚Äôll ever use them. If you‚Äôre buying a 20K tablet, I‚Äôm not sure you‚Äôre going to invest in expensive add-on accessories for this. But if you have something like Alexa docking station, it will fit right in.

Back side has a small camera bump which will make you feel like you‚Äôre going to damage the lens or something if you place it on a hard table, but the camera isn't any good to begin with so I wouldn't worry about that at all. Another thing: There's no screen protector included (I never use screen protectors on my devices anyway), and there's no cover as well. But it‚Äôs made of sturdy stuff and I‚Äôve been handling it rough for about a month and it‚Äôs doing great so far. Still, it is good idea to buy a cover/protector because you cannot escape screen-scratches in long term use.

4. Performance and Connectivity:
If you're looking for a tablet for book reading, multi-tasking, split-screen usage, multi-tab web browsing, watching 1080p videos on YouTube/Netflix, playing videos (upto 10bit-HEVC/x265 1080p) in MX Player, or some light Snapseed/Photoshop Express editing, Office applications like MS Word, Powerpoint or play games like Clash of Clans/PUBG casually... Then you're all set. 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, Mediatek 2.3+1.8GHz CPU and 128GB eMMC storage are enough. The hardware is mediocre and outdated but it works good enough.
Playing PUBG/Call of Duty at low settings will give you good performance just like any phone with 4GB RAM (with stereo audio without headphones). A good feature of having mediocre hardware is that it doesn't get very hot even after heavy use for a long time.

But if you demand anything more (High graphics settings, x264 or x265 4K videos, fast video encoding), then this won't do it. Gaming frame rates slow down to unplayable levels on high graphics settings and 4K videos stutter a lot during playback in both native player and MX player. Even 1080p videos, when heavily compressed in HEVC-x265 format have frame drops when playing back some intense, detailed action scenes.
Why? Because LPDDR 4 RAM and PowerVR 8320 are 2017-level hardware. That's probably why this tablet doesn't cost too much. You'll have to spend more money for powerful tablets if hardcore gaming and ultra-high performance is what you're looking for. By spending about Rs.9,000/- more you can get the base version of an iPad which is like 20 times faster, but more on that later.

It supports 4G SIM, Bluetooth 5.0, all the bells and whistles. No infrared though. It can simultaneously connect to a Wifi and work as hotspot router, and even has 5GHz mode for hotspot (which comes in handy when casting to an external display because 5GHz gives very minimal lag).
Wifi hotspot has extra features, like you can block devices even if they have your hotspot password, you can limit the number of devices than can connect to your tablet (from 2 to 10), and you can see the names and software of all the connected/blocked devices. So that gives you full router-like control over your wifi hotspot which is a good feature.

5. Battery:
This is a weird area ‚Äì it all depends on brightness. On one hand, this gives enough battery time to read books for many hours with Read Mode turned on. You can turn the Read Mode off and watch HD movies for like 4-5 hours and still have enough battery left to read/browse/work for 2-3 hours. And all that is with Auto-Brightness turned on and using tablet indoors.
With regular usage of browsing/reading, watching Full-HD Youtube and ample standby time in between, this tablet easily lasts 24 hours before it needs charging.
For networking, I charged it to 100% and inserted a BSNL SIM with limitless 3G data plan and used the tablet as Hotspot, I surfed the internet on computer using its hotspot all day, downloaded/uploaded about 24GB of data: Yes, BSNL is only mobile company that gives 3G plans with no speed limit no daily data limit. Screen was kept locked, only using it occasionally. At the end of the day it had a whopping 55% battery left after such a long usage of continuous 3G+Wifi hotspot at internet speeds of about 1.3 MB/sec. I liked it so much that I‚Äôve made this default hotspot for my PC usage.

But, if you turn off Auto-Brightness and increase the brightness to 100% (or use the tablet in bright light/daylight), battery backup gets cut down in half. Watching a 90-minute long 1080p-10bit-x265 video on full brightness will bring the battery from 98% to 59%. I guess the large backlit LCD display running at full brightness takes a LOT of power, so keep the brightness low with Blue filter on and it will last a lot longer.

It doesn't support fast-charging. Even when I used my MI-18W fast-charger, the battery charged at same, slow rate - about 2.5 to 3 hours from 1% to 100% - but charger itself got heated up. You should probably use its own charger and be content with what you get instead of trying incompatible chargers and damaging the battery.

6. Camera/Face Unlock:
Only thing the cameras are good for is videocalling. Other than that, they're pretty much useless. Not much details in the 8/5MP cameras. Even face unlock doesn't work well in dim-lit rooms/indoors/dark conditions (and indoor/dark conditions are where the tablet works best, so it's a bad tradeoff). Don't get me wrong, in well-lit conditions the face unlock works fine, even when you shave your beard or put on glasses. But in dark, its own screen light isn't bright enough to detect your face. A workaround is using a very white-ish/snowy wallpaper as your lockscreen and keep brightness at max ‚Äì that will shine enough light on your face to unlock screen in complete darkness.

6. OS: It is a pure Android 9.0 with Feb 2020 patch so it's as latest as Android Pie can get. It doesn't come with any customized UI, pre-installed adware, or useless apps/games that cannot be uninstalled ‚Äì It has none of those things and that makes this tablet a very good product right out of box. You get an unhampered Android OS without any useless overlays using your storage/RAM. It doesn't have any OS restrictions so you can install your own Home/Launcher app, change themes, keyboards, navigation style, whatever.

Android 10 has been officially released via OTA upgrade for this tablet and it works great! Performance has become much better, universal dark theme is a welcome feature. There are no lags whatsoever after using Android 10 on this for about a month.
Although, after upgrading to Android 10, you no longer have control over who can and cannot connect to you Wifi Hotspot, you cannot limit number of users and you cannot even see the names of the devices connected to you tablet's Wifi hotspot. This bugged me.

Attaching a wireless keyboard/mouse effectively turns the tablet into a complete PC, with a taskbar. Using PC/Productivity mode to write documents, create presentations and chat with people is just like having a mini laptop. Don‚Äôt expect Samsung Dex-like freedom, though. Still, you can enable ‚Äúforce resize‚Äù option in developer mode and every app (including Instagram that doesn‚Äôt support split-screen) will work split-screen in landscape mode. Switching apps from taskbar is fast and there's no lag that I‚Äôve noticed so far.
Then again, I don't use bloatware apps or games and always keep very neat, minimum set of apps with lots of free space so maybe that's the reason this tablet works so smooth for me? Who knows.

7. Accessories: It doesn't come with any accessories, not even headphones. Buying official Lenovo covers/folio covers or alexa speakers with this tablet doesn't make much sense. For a 20K tablet, even a simple folio cover that costs around 1200/- seems too expensive. Buying an expensive stylus/pen is of no use too, because drawing apps lag.

But there are alternatives: You can buy a cheap 10-inch Keyboard case for just 500/-, and a simple stylus pen for 400/- if you wanna take notes on this. These two things kind of complete this tablet (see pics) and effectively turn it into a working laptop computer where you can type long documents and mark PDFs, do videocalls etc.
For better results, you can buy a Bluetooth keyboard case by HOM for INR 2300/-. It has good leather cover, laptop-like detachable wireless keyboard with chiclet-island buttons.

Overall:
It's not a bad product. It's very good at what it's supposed to do. But thinking of it as a high-performer will get you disappointed. It's a good reading/watching/working tablet with huge storage. Let me tell you why it is good:
In similar or lower price range, you'll get 10.1-inch or smaller 7-inch tablets with 720p or maybe 1080p resolution. and upto 2/3 GB RAM (gaming is out of question there even at low settings). You‚Äôll get only 16:9 ratio which is less wide than Lenovo. The others, including more expensive iPads have like 32/64GB stroages with only Wi-Fi and no 3G/4G SIM, or maybe 3G/4G SIM for Internet only and no voice calling. You may get only one speaker, or two speakers sitting on the same side, Android support with up to Android 8.0, and they all come with custom UI, pre-installed useless malware that can't be uninstalled.

This tablet has a bigger 10.3-inch full-HD IPS screen, wider 16:10 portrait ratio, 4GB RAM, proper phone-like 4G SIM with calling support, a fast enough CPU, 128 GB storage with SD-card support, USB Type-C, dual stereo speakers with dual mics, Malware-free Pure Android 10, and enough capacity to play all android games on medium/low settings. There's not a single tablet in this price range that can give you all this together. This is by far cheapest 128GB tablet, cheapest 10.3-inch tablet and cheapest 4GB RAM tablet, and cheapest Android 10 tablet.
There are few things they could have done better - 1440p or AMOLED display, IR-face unlock, better battery, faster GPU. But asking for these things at 20K price seems pointless.
They could have given a fingerprint scanner and fast-charging though ‚Äì Those features are common in even the cheapest phones nowadays. This is the only reason I‚Äôm giving it a 4-star rating instead of 5.

Alternatives/Comparisons:
1. Going below 20K:
a) If you go a little low on the budget by even Rs.1000/-, the 19K tablets' specs drop down to 3GB RAM and 32GB storage e.g. IRA, DOMO etc which aren't even reliable brands.
b) Going as low as 15K will get you even lesser 2GB RAM, 16/32GB storage, slower CPU/GPU and no SIM support. e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tab A, Huawei Mediapad etc. If you're on budget and don't wanna spend 20K, those are good enough options.
c) Going further below will degrade the specs even more, and reduce screen size down to 8-inches. e.g. Alcatel 3T, Lenovo M8, Lenovo M10, Galaxy Tab A 8-inch and so on.

2. Going up 20K:
a) iPad 10.2-inch has larger 4:3 screen area, high-res Retina display, much faster CPU/GPU and incredible performance. For 30K, this is next-best option. Its downsides: you get only 32GB storage with no SD-card support, no SIM/calling support, very expensive accessories and limited customization. If your concern is only performance and you don't need large storage or phone calling, better go for it because its performance is unmatched in comparison to this Lenovo tab.
b) Samsung Galaxy S6 Lite: Larger display, Louder audio, S-pen included (albeit a fragile one), SD-card support, 4GB RAM, faster performance, larger battery. For 28K, this is also a good option. Downside: Again, no SIM/calling, lesser 64GB storage.

So, there you go. Best value for money in this price range.",4

1) 4GB RAM+ 128 GB storage for 20k Tab is the first in its segment
2) Thin bezels and FHD display makes the tablet future proof.
3) Best device for reading and entertainment with sufficient battery life
4) No bloatware, almost clean android experience
5) Decent audio output.

Cons-
1) Device is a bit slow, credits to its outdated 2017 year processor and useless graphic card.
2) The glass is not Corning gorilla and there are currently no accessories in indian market (screen guard or case) Be afraid!! Very afraid!!
3) Facial recognition is out of question. Doesn't work 90% of the time.
4) Brightness is not enough ~350 nits for reading in outdoor environment

Conclusion:
If you are looking for a 10 inch tablet with good display, storage, kids learning go for it.
Don't expect ipad kind of performance while gaming (PUBG, COD) however it manages to run in low graphic settings.
Over all LENOVO tab M10 FHD plus deserves 4.0 rating.",4
1166,"The tablet is good but I need help with the stylus.
The stylus is marked as Active pen 3 , but I couldn‚Äôt find out anything about it on the internet. Not even sure if Lenovo launched the active pen 3.
Need some help to figure the stylus out",4
1167,"1. Great display
2. No lags
3. Clean UI
4. Good for Multi-tasking
5. Not for gaming (no tablet in this price range is suitable for gaming)
6. Speaker Volume is a bit on the lower side
7. 128GB storage and 4GB ram- cherries on top

*Hope there will be an update for Android 10.

If you compare this with SAMSUNG A 10.1 priced at 15k, the extra 5k you'll be paying for this tablet is totally worth it as you get 4GB of ram and double the storage (128GB) compared to 2GB RAM (500mb actually available) and 64GB ROM. Furthermore, thinner bezels and a clean stock android experience add on to the margins in terms of overall experience.

In a nutshell, it's the best tablet in this price range. Though there are some compromises to be made as for the speakers and battery life which are not so bad tbh but we can't complaint at this price point.

Hope this helps :)",4

Reviewing after 15 days Used.

You're getting a 10.3-inch 1920x1200 display with 128GB storage - for Just 20k INR.

Analysis:

1. Display:
It is a brilliant, IPS panel with very good colors, allows very wide viewing with only minimal color change over extreme angles, and a 16:10 full-HD ratio. It's bigger than most tablets and even iPads (they are all 10.1 inches while this is 10.3). In Portrait mode it is as wide as two Redmi Note 8 screens side by side - which makes it a perfect choice for reading and browsing. Brightness isn't the highest i've seen, but it has OK sunlight readability in max brightness if you're planning on reading/surfing; but Movies/videos are best watched indoors.
It has a 'Productivity Mode' under display settings which turns the bottom Navigation bar into PC/Mac-like Taskbar, where are all your open apps appear as icons and can be opened/closed directly without going into overview mode, and the home/back/task navigation buttons are pushed to corner to be used with a single thumb.
2. Design: It's a good, sturdy, metal-finish body with very narrow bezels around screen. The volume/lock buttons are textured which gives good feel to use them. USB-C is good to have, and it also has those things called ""Pogo"" connectors on side, which are Lenovo's own connector points to attache keyboard/accessories.

3. Performance:
If you're looking for book reading, multi-tasking, split-screen usage, multi-tab web browsing, watching 1080p videos on YouTube/Netflix, playing 10bit-HEVC/x265 1080p videos in MX Player, or some light Snapseed/Photoshop editing, office applications like MS Word, Powerpoint or play games like Clash of Clans... Then you're all set. 4GB LPDDR4 RAM, Mediatek 2.3/1.8GHz CPU and 128GB eMMC storage are enough.
Even playing PUBG/Call of Duty at low settings will give you very good performance just like any phone with 4GB RAM (with awesome audio without headphones).
Another good feature of having mediocre hardware is that it doesn't get very hot even after heavy use of whatever it can handle for long time.
ardware. That's why this tablet doesn't cost twice its price. You'll have to sp

4. Battery:
This is a weird area. On one hand, this gives enough battery time to read books for many hours with Auto-Brightness + Read Mode turned on. You can even turn the Read Mode/Blue filter off and watch HD movies for like 4-5 hours and still have enough battery left to read/browse/work for 2-3 hours. And all that is with Auto-Brightness turned on and using tablet indoors.
For networking, I charged it to 100% and inserted a BSNL SIM with limitless 3G data plan and used the tablet as Hotspot, I surfed the internet on computer using its hotspot all day, downloaded/uploaded about 14GB of data, Watched YouTube etc. Yes, BSNL is only mobile company that gives 3G plans with no speed limit no daily data limit. Only drawback is they don't give ultra-fast 4G, but 3G speed of 1.2 MB/sec is more than enough. Screen was kept locked, only using it occasionally. At the end of the day it had a whopping 55% battery left after such a long usage of continuous 3G+Wifi hotspot.

But, if you turn off Blue Filter and increase the brightness to 100% (or use the tablet in bright light/daylight), battery times gets cut down in half. Just watching a 1-hour long 1080p-10bit-x265 video will bring the battery from 98% down to 59%. I guess the large backlit LCD display running at full brightness takes a LOT of battery, so keep the brightness low with Blue filter on and it will last much, much longer.

Also, They didn't give a fast-charger in the box, and even when I used my own fast-charger, the battery charges at same, slow rate - about 2.5 to 3 hours from 1% to 100%. So you should always use it's own charger and be content with what you get instead of trying incompatible chargers and damaging the battery/hardware.

5. Camera/Face Unlock:
Only thing the cameras are good for is video calling and showing the people what's in front of tablet and behind over the internet. Other than that, they're pretty much useless. Not much details in the 8/5MP cameras. Even face unlock doesn't work well in dim-lit rooms/indoors/dark conditions (and indoor/dark conditions are where the tablet works best, so it's a bad tradeoff).

6. OS: It is a neat, pure Android 9.0 with Feb 2020 patch so it's as latest at Android Pie can get. It doesn't come with any cusomized UI, pre-installed adwares, or useless apps/games that sometimes cannot be uninstalled. No, it has none of those things and it makes this tablet very good product out of box. You get an unhampered Android OS without any useless overlays using your storage/RAM. And it doesn't have any restrictions so you install your own Home/Launcher app, change themes, keyboards, navigation style whatever.
Android 10 might take very long to come for this so don't wait for updates. What it has works good enough.

OVERALL -
1. Great display -Bit laggy in beginning but very good now.
2. Great Speakers.
3. Clean UI
4. Good for Multi-tasking,Online Learning etc
5. Not for gaming (no tablet in this price range is suitable for gaming)
6. Speaker Volume good with Dolby.
7. 128GB storage and 4GB ram- cherries on top.
8. Camera‚Äôs very low usually for video calling only.

This tablet has a huge, 10.3-inch full-HD IPS screen, 4GB RAM, proper phone-like single 4G SIM support, 128 GB storage with SD-card support, USB Type-C, dual stereo speakers with dual mics, Malware-free Pure Android 9, and capacity to play games on high framerates with low settings.

There's not a single tablet in this price range that can give you all this together.
Best in its Price Range. Better than Samsung Tab 10.1 .",4
1171,"Well! After 3 more years of same M Series Tab finally Lenovo came out with updated model and its really amazing. Amazon delivery is really fast. Updating after 1 week use:

Pros:-
1. Talking about the device in this Price range, Mediatek Helio P22 does a great job. Not a High end Processor but enough to keep you entertained. Multitasking is smooth.

2. The display is amazing. It's an IPS LCD Panel but it doesn't disappoints. Colours, Saturation and Viewing Angles are good. Watched 1080p Blueray Videos and surprised. Works really great.

3. I am not a heavy gamer. Don't go for negative reviews about gaming. I have played Asphalt 9, Pubg( in med. Settings) and COD. High settings didn't supprted but surprisingly no lag at all in med. Setting.

4. Office working Apps like Office, Photoshop and even I edited videos. Works totally fine. Taking bit time to reload ( High end video editing apps) but once opened no lag at all.

Cons:-
1. Well In this price segment you can't expect much but comparing directly to its competitors Huawei Mediapad M5 Lite, It should have atleast a fast charger support along with 7000 mah battery. Though I have watched 2 movies in medium brightness with Eye care mode on from 100% it went down to 35%. Decent Battery not great.

2. Device seems to be a bit heavy and absence of fingerprint scanner is really annoying. Always have to give pattern.

Overall, In this price Range, You will get FHD display with so narrow bazels gives you an amazing experience. It's really worth every penny of it. In this price segment Best Tab.",4
1172,"Tablet is good for studets and for some office purpose.

More intersting thing observed that Amazon app not compatable in this tablet .

I have not see case for this tablet in the Amazon or other sites.",4
1173,"Thanks amazon for on-time delivery .
About Tab:
Screen: Screen size good enough to learn or watch videos online , Screen brightness is good indoor but not that good for outdoor.You have keep full bright while watching videos or online class which actually drains battery faster .Touch is good .
Sound: Sound is fantastic with speakers provided at both side .Dolby Atmos is superb.
Processing:Tab works smoothly with 4 gb or ram but sometimes a lil lag in operations which is not common .Tried drawing apps and it works well , Overall it's good .
Body: Well built body with metal back cover and overall tab looks good in design .

Gaming : If you are buying it for gaming better try other options as processing of games are quite slower which is visible while playing .

Note : Hope one day all these gadgets will be manufactured in India someday as this is made in china and doesn't looks good ""made in china "" behind tab .",4
1174,"Good
1. Pen pressure is good working.
2. In Display drawing option is nice one
Bad
1. No additional or extra nibs
2. Battery performance is bad (maximum 5hr with internet)
3. Pen and tab need to keep separately , no attaching option",4
1175,"I bought the 2GB version after a thorough research and analysis of my expected use case.

Tldr: I would recommend this for students who want to use it as an accessory to studying but not as a primary tool simply because it is just to laggy to do anything on, if you are looking at pages all day long the lag is negligible but when start swapping between apps and doing any normal task you will feel the lagging.
It is cheap for a reason, if you are a student who wants to use it to read pdf while studying and exclusively for that purpose to for it, if you want to do anything else on this tablet get the 4gb.
I use multiple reading app with integrated dictionary, formulae, charts making studying fun and effective.

FOR READING:
I use it exclusively for reading and nothing else, I was going for a Kindle but realised I did not own a tablet.
Next thing will be a Kindle but I am enjoying reading on this tablet, the screen is big and there is a grayscale option which makes the screen b/w and an absolute treat to read on. I didn't think it would be this easy to move from books to a tablet but some features on the tablet like grayscale, eye care, do not disturb among others make this tablet great for use as a reader.
I would recommend this for student who want to use it as an accessory to studying but not as a primary tool simply because it is just to laghu to do anything on, if you are looking at pages all day long the lag is negligible but when start swapping between apps and doing any normal task you will feel the lagging.
It is cheap for a reason, of you are a student who wants to use it to read pdf while studying and exclusively for that purpose to for it, if you want to do anything else on this tablet get the 4gb.

FOR Multitasking or normal tablet use:
Look elsewhere the 2gb variant even though cheap is too laggy for most people, even when downloading books or taking screenshots I can see the tablet struggle. I use it exclusively for reading for I don't mind the temporary lagging.
I would say this is essentially unusable for most things and one should look at getting the 4GB variant.

FOR GAMING/MULTITASKING:
The 2gb variant is absolutely not for gaming, most games won't even load.

Final thoughts: The price of the tablet considering the massive screen and additional functionality made it a bargain for me with my limited use case. The screen is 1920x1200, 2 gb isn't enough to drive that.
The screen and touch response is fine as expected from tech that has recieved many refinements, it has reached the point where it is rarely a point of concern.
Absolutely enjoying reading on this thing, I have already read 3 books, a total of 900-1000 pages.",4

1178,"I like the screen size which is 10.3 in, big enough size. Second the specification are enough for normal operations unless one needs higher spects for gaming, where it may be a little under spect. Third, LTE Sim slot provided at this price point, which is simply a great offer. The touch screen is very intuitive and has a great response. The color response is truly dynamic. The screen bajels are thin which add to the overall look of the tablet. Overall it's been a good buy, espcially for my kids, who need a tab for thier routine zoom/Google meet online classes in these times of corona pandemic. The only downside is the audio which could have been better, the volume is kind of low even by mobile phone comparison and the audio could have been a little bit more beefier, rather than mostly shrills, which is usually the case.",4
1179,"The first one I got was faulty; within couple of days, the screen had vertical lines and luckily the replacement period was not over yet, hence I got the replacement without any hassle, otherwise I would have ended up running around to get the screen replaced.
I have bought this for my son to take his online class and completing homework if it is directly in school website and also to play his favourite games; the camera resolution front and back are good, the clarity for video calls using zoom is good. There is no lag while playing racing games or arcade games; high end games not sure how it will behave.
The tablet is not that heavy, so kids can easily carry around without any hassle; and the screen size is 10 inch so you can see more and easy to use; not too much stress on the eyes.

Initially I thought this is a buffering issue but it stayed the same but buffering and playback was no issue due to decent processor so I got used to it.

But It came back today 23/08/2021 and also hanging issues while video streaming in whatsapp. Amazon was contacted who directed us to contact Lenovo on their toll free number.

PROS:
- Good build quality. As expected from Lenovo devices, the tablet is of a great build.
- Responsive touch screen with accurate color reproduction.

CONS:
- Very poor chip performance. Top end games cannot be played on this device. Screen stutters a lot. GPU is extremely poor.
- No software support. According to the Lenovo website, this device is eligible for only 1 year of updates. Thus, you will be stuck with Android 10. There were no security updates as well after completion of 1 year.
- Cannot stream HDR content without lags due to poor GPU performance.",4

2. Battery is ok. For Normal standby - 2 days. Continuous use with 4G data & video ( online classes) - 8 Hrs. But if turn ON hotspot, then 6 to 7Hrs. Obviously it is expected.
Dislikes :
1. Sound quality. Really pathetic. Not clear audio kind of Cracking sound. No issues for online classes as it is only speech. But songs it's not good.

 I am writing this review after 4months of usage.

I bought this tablet on Aug-14.honestly i am saying

1.i never got version upgrade /update.
2.the GUI is very low

The tablet is not physically damaged as you can see in the video. It starts to appear glitching flashes and horizontal and vertical lines randomly. I know why it is happening because of the poor screen quality. The tablet still is in warranty. So kindly please provide me a refund/replacement.

I never thought Appario Retail Private Ltd will sell this low quality tablets. I contact the seller more than 10times. No one is picking up my call and i contacted the Amazon

They asking me to contact the seller.

I dont know what to do

So please resolve my issue

Still i have the price tag, box, charger all materials as new",4
1216,"Looks good but is slow on the inside.performance is slow.battery drains fast but takes 3¬Ω plus to charge from 10% to 100%
Absolutely no option of fast charging even if you use a 20w fast charger.
Didn't come with a charging dock which I was expecting in this price not did I get the free gift that was included in the product description.
Good for kids online stuff but keep in mind the very very very poor battery performance",4
1217,Overall product is good and has good value for money however biggest drawback is that MS word and Excel aren't pre-installed. One will need to buy MS office if kids are using it for online classes,4
1218,"Have given it 3 stars cause there is a major software issue. The screen shuts automatically anytime. It doesnt matter whether u r watching something, it just shuts automatically.
Having hard times with amazon to get it returned. Pathetic customer service first time with any product.",4
1219,"It's a very great tablet like Good screen quality , good build quality ,good lag free performance but few things I don't find is up to mark
Like
first battery sucks if you don't use battery saver mode all the times
Second Laptop randomly reboots itself it happened 2 times in last three days and I googled it it's a firmware lenovo problem
Third and finally It's pen this tablet doesn't support any active pen so the pen given with this is nothing but a touch stylus nothing else ,
So I guess I'll be applying for refund and buy some other tablet with proper battery and none of this random restart stuff",4

 Lenovo m10 is very good and has 4GB ram 128GB memory and it is very easily To Handle and it's great for kids. I am also looking at battery backup. are running fine. The graphics of the game are not that special but are also very good and not so bad Everything was fine, but when I unboxed it, I saw that inside which is scratched?
When I opened the box, there is a slight stain on the back side. As you can also see, it is not good to stain a new product. It does not look good and looks a bit bad, so I had complained a little about this, so after the complaint, the order came after the replacement. Patori place was not found, because of customer care mistake, they did not take the complaint properly and sent some other photo instead of my scratch photo. Due to which the Amazon delivery dealer refused to take that product and did not take it from that increase. After that I tried refund to give me another one but it didn't happen then they said that I will be refunded the money. Butt said that the second will not be replaced again, so when did I say okay, it will happen. Otherwise, the time of the 4th was given after that. After that the time of 8th will go again. Then after a long time, I placed the order on 28th September and did not come on 29th. It came and not even after that. I had complained about this on the 2nd, so I did not like the time till the 8th. Let this new product take so much time, I am working on what it is. Just a request to Amazon that this should not happen to me again.",4
1221,All works good and definitely a value for money product. The only issue that I find is with microphone. It feels very frustrating to say one thing time and again because the person on other side don't hear what we say. If can be resolved somehow then it's an amazing product.,4
1222,"Best budget friendly tab by Lenovo.. best tab for kids online classes and other activities like reading ebooks and watching videos or learning purpose, but the only issue is it's battery and very much slow charging.. Lenovo need to improve its battery quality, otherwise best budget friendly tab",4
1223,"Tablet is Ok for reading PDF and watching few videos.

Few things I noticed after 4 days of use -
1) Battery lasts for about a day
2) Camera quality isn't good but ok for video calling
3) I don't play games or watch too much movies so can't comment on that.
4) I bought it mainly for study purpose, so I needed to write on tablet to make notes. The response of pen provided with this tablet is little slow but still ok if you write slow.
5) MAJOR DRAWBACK -
The tablet turn off automatically sometimes for no reason. There is some bug in the software or hardware. It really gets annoying sometimes.

The tablet is ok but for 20K, a little better experience is expected.
Rating - 3.5/5",4

We are using this one for only kids online classes still it's showing slow performance.

1229,Within 6 days of buying I feel the pinch of insufficient battery back up. Battery charge drops from 100 % to 18 % after 2.5 hours of zoom class. Not sure if this is natural.

1230,I wanted to give it 5* but unable as the first time it happend to me i lost so many valuable data when i tried to copy and paste my old phones data through pc. The horrible thing happend to me was that it pasted the files including 10-20% data to its internal memory(119GB) and deleted the source files automatically without informed window i.e. copy/paste fails.,4
1231,The features in the tab are really good and it affordable price. But still after it using it for month now it showing some trouble that is some time it is going black and turing off. If not it become heat while charging and cant do heavy usage. Apart from that it is functioning good. There is clarity and screen is big with good sound quality. First I was worried in buying product online but now the product is good if above mentioned problem are not there it will be great and I will be given 5star.,4

2)warranty it shows from the day it got import ed from China, not from the day it got delivered to you.",4
1264,"*Pros:*
* S-Pen works well. Had to pay ‚Çπ2.5K more for the pen model. So, not very much impressed there.
* Display/screen is average. Colors look right.
* The device I received was already upgraded to Android 10.
* Physically, the device looks and feels nice.

*Major issues and flaws:*
* The battery performance is very poor. In fact, from the low capacity it was somewhat expected. But not to such extent. Battery drains real fast. Roughly one hour of moderate usage like web-browsing, note-taking, etc. (no games/video), and charge drops from 100% to 60%. And then, because fast-charge is not supported, to get it charged back takes another hour. Actually, I would say battery performance is pathetic for a tablet priced at such value.
* Missing an important security feature: This was a major let down for me. In today's world, security and privacy are becoming more and more relevant. Android 10 boasts so many privacy and security features. So, I was hoping to make use of them. When I installed sd card on the device and looked for option to encrypt it, could not find option in the settings anywhere. Looked at the lenovo forums and found people discussing this topic with no solution. So, my conclusion is that this feature is not present.
Either we have to format the card as internal storage and lose access to the actual 128GB internal storage, or leave the sd card un-encrypted. So, for my device, anyone having access to the device (either today or if it gets misplaced in future), they can simply take out the sd card and connect to their pc/tab etc. and make a copy of all the data present there. Not a great scenario considering that Android 10 supports this feature, and lenovo actively chose to prevent it.
* Sometimes touch-screen behaviour is erratic: If the hand is touching even the black border outside of the screen, then touches on the actual screen region are sometimes not registered properly.

If I had the option to return this, I would have definitely done so. Lot of poor design choices from lenovo; this is going to be the last lenovo product I have purchased. Cutting costs to keep prices low only works to some extent, and after that manufacturers start producing crappy products at slightly lower prices than their competitors.

Bottom line: Would recommend to go little higher in pricing and purchase from another manufacturer.",4
1265,"Don't buy this tablet. I bought two and I'm stuck with it since I did not unbox it on time for the return. THIS DOES NOT SUPPORT HD ON NETFLIX OR ANY STREAMING SERVICE EXCEPT YOUTUBE. It's crazy that Lenovo isn't fixing it. They only have an L3 certification but Netflix needs an L1. So you'll need stuck like me if you buy this as there is no return option, only replacement. The whole reason I bought this tablet was to stream videos in HD. What good is a full HD screen when you don't have the basic software for HD streaming. It's a very rude shock. Also this tablet is kinda slow too. This is one of my worst purchase decisions ever.",4
1266,"Camera clarity is horrible, missing screen mirroring/screen cast, official software for usb backup missing, screen brightness not sufficient, eye protection mode is not efficient, not upgradeable os ,no official os update, battery drain fast, type otg cable not comings, handsfree not coming, fingerprint sensor not coming, not worth buying waste of money",4
1267,The product started well. Then we clicked on kids mode and games. The tab hung up. It did not boot again. Had to return the product. Technician visit....customer care...too much time and energy waste. Still waiting for the refund money. Faulty Product has been picked up 3 days earlier....poorest service by Amazon...never expected...,4
1268,"Very disappointed, how it could be such an issue with brand like Lenovo. Ordered replacement yet same issue with replaced Tab..had to order refund. ISSUE- Display sleeps abruptly despite setting screen sleep time as prefixed, while surfing or content/video is playing, screen sleeps...u tap screen, opens exactly at same instance where u were surfing or watching video but this abrupt sleep, screen close keeps on happening repeatedly in both orders. Original order filed for replacement, tecnician did not bother to visit and he filed replacement on phone call only...now replacement product filed for Refund only but mandatory technician visit has to happen, let see he visits this time or still prefers to close call by filing refund over call only. Highly disappointed and not expected either from Lenovo nor from Amazon.",4
1269,"Pros:
1. Looks Good .....
2. Nice & Loud Speakers...

Cons:
1. Don't get fooled by advertisements and reviews this 2GB RAM variant is too slow in processing. Even mild games such as Subway Surfer and temple run hanged up a lot during play.

2. There is no use of FHD Plus screen because due to low ram, video output still remains pixelated when a 720p or above video is played.

3. Touch response is too slow I think that's too because of low 2GB RAM

Conclusion:
I recommend to buy the same model with higher RAM i.e. 3GB/4GB instead of this to play along the complete output from this TAB",4
1270,"I am not going to get technical but will give a review based on many tabs, mobile phones, laptops that I have used.
It's just an ok product for the price. You can get much better deal with cheaper ones.
Camera quality is horrible but what hurts is the battery life. I was watching Netflix and in two hours the battery was almost dead from 80%. Do a little more research and buy better tabs. I won't recommend this tab at all",4

Not recommended for heavy users.. students can use this for classes and keep it charging for whole day.",4
1276,"Adding 3 pros and 3 cons, you can judge for yourself:

Advantages-
Charges pretty fast (about 2.5 hours) and battery life is decent
Display quality is good enough for regular use
Maybe that it has FM Radio?

Disadvantages-
Randomly restarts about 10 times a day in the middle of use
Touch screen intermittently stops working
Does not have any basic apps like a file manager, gallery, or music player.

Purchased in August of this year and regretting.",4
1277,I'm regretting not waiting for other companies to release their products in this price range. I thought 2 GB ram would be enough but it lags a lot even when you are just using the tablet without any app in the background and it restarts automatically and feels like a 2016 device. Please wait for some new tablets to release like realme pad etc which will cost even less than this pathetic excuse of a tablet.,4

1305,"The overall Tab is nice or good for basic use.. If you want to online meetings, video multitasking between apps it stuck or hanged..Also, you battery get drained in one day, if you held video meetings for 2-3 hrs.. From Software, design looks, sound quality tab is very good.",4
1306,This was a birthday gift and I had paid for the gift wrapping and message card as well. The product was neither gift wrapped nor was the message card included. This is very disappointing. Why charge and offer a service when you have no intention to honour it.,4
1307,It runs out of charge very quickly. Daily morning tab is in shuts down mode saying 0%. No matter if you leave it in 95% or 50%. If always in 0% in the morning. Even I tried turning off wifi and mobile data at night. It‚Äôs very disappointing,4

1312,Its cheap in performance as well as price. Touch is very poor and hangs even while playing youtube videos (even though i dont have much of apps installed considering the 2gb ram).Sound quality is decent.,4
1313,Sound quality was not up to the mark. Touch screen strucks some times. Video or movie are not maximising and there is no clarity of display.,4
1314,"I am not at all happy with this product . A full hd tab is not for just reading .it should support the Hd content streaming of two primary movie apps such as netflix and amazon prime . On this device it plays movies on sd format on Prime and netflix .Only Youtube and zee5 supports hd content .

Negatives about this product.
1)This tab doesn't support FHD Or HD streaming content on Amazon prime, Netflix, Sunnxt even though the tab is FHD
2)This device doesn't have the L1 certification to play the Hd content on Amazon prime, Netflix, Sunext. It has only L3 certification
3) Not sure if lenovo has plan to get the L1 certification to play the videos on hd format in prime and Netflix
4)Google Duo app cam quality is very poor
5)Amazon doesn't accept return on this product it has only replacement .
6)Full charge battery get drained in 4 hrs if you watch a movie on hd format in youtube or attending the online class

I did said about the problem to amazon they did not accept for return . so with pain i have to live with this tab .
if it is for just reading you can go for other cheaper options than this",4
1315,"I purchased this product on 18th oct and today on 20th i m facing this issue of tablet getting hanged.
Worse part is even after having the policy of return and refundable product the customer care of amazon asking me to get it sorted out with technician.
Till yesterday i was trusting amazon as the best service provider as they take the stand with the customer always but with this incident i feel like deceived by the brand.
Spending 20k and thw very next day getting the prpduct repaired is the worse i experienced.

My suspicion is right, I'm facing battery drainage issues, auto shutdown, they are not specified what kind of processor they used, they said Hexacore! Using 4G airtel Sim is another headache, tablet not receiving proper signals.. Please go for samsung..",4
1319,"I usually don't write reviews of products by my god this tab is terrible.
Ram - 2GB is not at all sufficient since 1.7-1.8 gb is occupied by android os so you just have 250 mb for apps to load hence switching between apps will kill the recent apps so no multitasking is possible. If you load more apps, the tab overloads and it will just reboot which is frustrating.
Battery - using cellular 4g and streaming videos i got only 3 hrs 50 min of screen on time watching videos which is terrible. Attachment in image's screenshot
HD streaming - this tab has a beautiful display but no point since Netflix, prime video, hotstar and other apps only stream in SD not in HD due to no l1 support. Only YouTube will work on HD.
Storage - out of 32 gb 8 gb is occupied out of box
Processor - not very snappy apps loads after sometime and ui lags a lot
Overall this is a useless product to begin with i got fooled by reading the good fake reviews.

But please take this advice seriously and don't get trapped on its mentioned features. Go with the standard product like Samsung tabs though they are on higher price when compared to Lenovo product. I think, its high time that even Amazon takes notice of such products and stops selling them on their site. I am not sure why but Amazon has not been impressive with the products that they sell. I blindly went for few products on Amazon assuming that they would be of good quality and hence are on the Amazon site. But this myth completely broke when I bought this product as this was the 3rd DEFECTIVE product (see the list of defective products below) among the products that i purchased on Amazon.
1. Sumeet Traditional Mixer (didn't get a refund or replacement for this product)
2. Koryo hand blender 6 in 1 (got a replacement after 6 months of hard fight with amazon and koryo customer care but even that piece is defective)

That's for me a very huge disappointment.

The technical person came and gave report as it need to be replaced.

We wasted with 20 days already for waiting this.

Again we called customer care and informed the pickup person not ready to pickup the product as it‚Äôs not booting . But the actual problem is that only. Again they arranged a call and that time also pickup person not ready to take . Am not sure what is the communication going between customer care and delivery person.

So much for buying a ""branded"" product, Lenovo has proven to be a disappointment.

Don't go for this.",4
1343,I had to return the product twice. The screen was just black and white stripes when turned on. That's it. Nothing else on display. It took nearly a month for the whole process of returning.

4.Sound output bad....

It's a waste of my money that's what I assume

Next thing is Amazon people... I called them after exactly 1 week and the person on the other end after 20min of conversation says it's LATE.

It's extremely slow. Horrible performance. if you type one letter in Outlook or in Teams, wait for min 10sec to display it. Its that kind of slow. Totally useless product for serious user. If you want to buy it for job like Watching video go for it... Its not meant for proper work... purpose",4

A few dys ago as I was reading, the tablet suddenly turned blurry as posted above. I switched it off and on (am not a tech person), and it stayed.

I registered a complaint with Lenovo on the app soon after noticing on 14 August 2021. I got a call today (16th) asking me to start in safe mode. No change.

I was advised to take it to a third party service center ~ 20 kms from my place as it is a 'hardware' issue and that the 'display' will be replaced. I wanted them to come home, but they have no such option :(

I am most disappointed, as I was looking to switch from Apple iPad to an Android tablet. Thought Lenovo will be good as I had a good experience with its laptop.

Obviously laptop experience did not translate into a good tab experience. I am not sure what experience I will have and if my tablet will ever be back to functioning as a new / 1 month tab.

I usually keep my devices for a long time (mobile for 5 years for eg) and was hoping to keep the tablet for many years. Feeling bitterly disappointed.",4

I haven't used any other smart speaker before but I am very happy with my purchase. Below are some observations :
1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.
2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.
3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.
4. Understands the Indian accent very well. Sometimes I am amazed by how well it picks up stuff.
6. Kids love it. An added advantage is that they can take help for homework and talking to alexa also motivates them to talk in English",4.4

 Such an amazing product it responds from where ever I call it from my room . It does slow down when my data internet is over its just amazing . It does play all musics from all languages it can tell jokes ,can turn lights tv etc on or off. It can speak and understand Hindi and English
It plays all songs I have tried Telugu English and Hindi
It does play what ever songs you want
And it can roast you or your friend anyone
You can even call through that
I just love it",4.4

It works seemlessly with my smart home devices, and the app is fantastic. It yet doesn't have support with fire TV stick, but Amazon assures it'll arrive by mid-november, so that's something to look out for. The app works great, and you can control your smart home or this dot from anywhere in the world, as long both of your devices have an internet connection. It's a fun little party trick, really. I couldn't be more happier with my echo dot. Also, as you can see in the picture, I got the sophisticated looking white color ;)

Edit: It has fire TV support now, it's not the best experience, but hey - it WORKS.",4.4
1367,"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.
->Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.
->Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.
->Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).
->Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.
->Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.
->Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.
->Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.
Conclusion->If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).
UPDATE!!!-> Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.",4.4
1368,"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:
Pro's.
1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.
2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.
3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT
4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.
5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.
6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.
7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.
8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.

Cons.
1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.

Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....",4.4
1369,"1) Firstly, you may be confused whether to buy Google Home or Alexa. If you are an Amazon Prime customer, the choice is a no-brainer because you get Amazon Music for free as well as tight integration with Amazon Products.
2) The sound produced by this device is good for filling one bedroom with rich sound. Arijit Singh never sounded so deep :).
3) The microphone is super sensitive. You can even whisper ""Alexa"" and the device will pick it up.
4) The Alexa skills available are amazing which can be turned on through the companion app. Few skills you should try are
4.1) Radio tuning=> Just say Alexa Play Radiocity. Get back into the radio habit.
4.2) For the religious => Just say Alexa wake me up at 6 AM to Suprabhatam. Done deal.
4.3) For the romantic => Just say Alexa open Love Shayari. Ghalib at your finger tips.
4.4) Want a multiplayer quiz fight => Just say Alexa QuizMaster. You will be playing it at 10 AM.
4.5 ) Interactive Stories for Kids => Just say Alexa MagicDoor.
4.6) Apps by Magoosh to build vocabulary are awesome.
5) Alexa can calculate, tell you the calories in an egg, convert feet to inches and all the regular things.
6) The most useful features
6.1) Alexa add milk to shopping list. Viola! milk is added as a list item in the shopping list on your app. Very useful for my wife.
6.2) Drop In using your Alexa App to talk to people at home. Very useful.
7) Setting Alexa up is a breeze and since she is cloud based the intelligence keeps improving.

Alexa has thoroughly impressed my family and now everyone wants one for their room. Waiting for the next sale.",4.4
1370,"It‚Äôs jus beyond awesome.üëåüèªüòçüòçüòç I thought dot is bit small so the sound quality may affect due to size but really it‚Äôs really a beast. The sound system is jus beyond my expectations in one room the sound to the full volume is very loud.
Pros:
I have syska led smart bulb too which works wonder wid this amazon dot.
It‚Äôs also works with fire tv stick.
Sound quality is jus fab.
Look wise it‚Äôs beautiful
Can be commanded being in different room.
Cons:
Cannot take multiple instructions especially when u r operating wid fire stick.

Please don‚Äôt take a second thought to buy this beauty.
I got this for 3k in amazon great festival.",4.4
1371,"3rd gen product is just awesome. Very much improved version...indian english accent is no longer the issue . It's skill based product and Not search based like google home , so I guess you might not get answers to all questions since the skill need to be added. I have not used Google home...not sure if it searched in google engine and find answers to all your query. Part sound quality is just awesome...you do not need a speaker to connect. Looks wise an excellent one. I am fan of it now.",4.4

Complete value for money!
Alexa is lob..",4.4
1373,"My childhood friend and a great well-wisher Sri Radha Krishnan gifted me Rs. 3000/- and wanted me to buy anything that I like.
I thought, I should buy something that is very special in my lifetime and fortunate to get a Third Gen Amazon Eco Dot at that price during Amazon Great Indian Sale.
I feel, my REVIEW here should be different and I am not repeating anything said already.
I placed ECO Dot permanently into an electrical socket by doing some neat homework, which you can see in the pictures.
What I learnt, We need to ask diplomatically to the point first.
For example, I asked Alexa, calorie value of a banana ? and Alexa could not answer. She answered beautifully when the same query put into a different way, nutrition value of a banana.
Kindly include (from 1960s) old classical songs from Tamil and Hindi movies.
Hope, Alexa learn more and more every day & soon create a very rich database and focused locally as well..

TIPS:
1. If you like to keep on wall power socket as I did, you must use only original 3M Double sided tape (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013JM1SCY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). After pasting the tape and attaching both plug and the unit leave an hour for bonding before inserting into a wall socket tightly to avoid falling down. If you do not like, you can separate them neatly anytime in future by using a Dental floss/ fishing rod nylon thread.
2. I have paired the ECO DOT with my AV Receiver (ONKYO HTS 3370) easily but you need little patience. Switch on ECO DOT and the Blue Tooth Device make them search and pair. Alexa will confirm and you need to say ‚ÄòAlexa connect to speaker‚Äô in future. While configuring, never keep open other BT devices like your Laptop/ Mobile to avoid over lapping.",4.4
1374,Its just one if the best deal i ever got on amazon I purchased it with a 12 watt wipro light at 2200 and enjoying it since last 2 daya its my 4th echo device and yes I would highly recommend buying a product with this just search echo dot wall mount you ll see a 800-900 rupees wall mount trust me it will make a huge difference between sound and transportability plus when its on wall if will recognise your voice quicker as it faces you on the wall seriously guys the combination of these two is compulsory,4.4
1375,"An incredible technology interface brought by Amazon. It's still our first week and I must say its has become an interface for me to enjoy the music across era's , create my own playlists, for my young kids to listen to stories and learning and improving general / world knowledge and learning different languages, for my mother to enjoy spiritual music while my better half getting amused how a kid of 4 years to elders in family all enjoy such a technology marvel all at the same time. Experience it, explore it and enjoy it... everyday.",4.4
1376,"I have given this to all my grandparents, now they can call me with just their voice. Even if they fall or are in any emergency they can still call me and I can check in on them regularly with the drop in feature.

It can also read them the bible and play them the songs they want, lets them check on the cricket score from bed and it can answer most of the trivia question they throw at it.",4.4
1377,"So I got the 3rd generation Echo Dot during Amazon great Indian sale. I had actually tested the 2nd generation Echo Dot and Echo few months back and was not that impressed with the sound quality, the 2nd Gen Dot was hopeless. Let me put down the pro's and con's of the 3rd generation Echo Dot

Pro's.
1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.
2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.
3. You can enable lot of skills. Skills are like apps created by third party developer, you just need to enable them based on your requirement.
4. Smart home features works very well. I love controlling lights with Alexa.
5. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT
6. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.
7. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.
8. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.
9. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.
10. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.

Cons.
1. Alexa can place order for you from Amazon but you gotta be very specific. Let's say you asked Alexa to buy a T Shirt, she doesn't give you options on the color or size. If you give specific details in the first command, then she will place the correct one in the cart but it's not easy. She is only good to order groceries from Amazon.
2. I found some bugs with her, sometimes she asks me to try the command after a while. She rebooted once when she was not able to process the command. Also I found issues when using certain skills. I'm sure Amazon will fix those issues.
3. Audio quality is good but not great. I know that she is not just a speaker, but clarity could have improved when listening to music. Connect to a bigger speaker with AUX or bluetooth if you're not satisfied with sound quality. Please don't compare Dot with JBL or similar, I've seen it in few reviews. If you're an audiophile and want excellent sound quality, then don't look at the Echo range of products.
4. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.

Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buy when compared to Google Home.",4.4
1378,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA. So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!! Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers. This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness. While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that. Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times. Just grab this before it goes back to its old price. Even the smart bulb is very helpful. While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb. Just go for it before its too late,4.4
1379,"It's true that Alexa could more than just a simple voice assistant that plays music on your request.
It listens to anything you say and answers smartly. Alexa got an attitude which is quite amazing.
Siri, Cortana, and other voice assistants are no match for Alexa. Alexa acts better than Google in terms of finding information.

It can almost answer to any anything whether your question related to history, IPL cricket scores or mythology. Alexa answers all of them with details.

You can literally have a conversation with her and she is a great distraction when you're really tired of talking to real people.

The money you spend on this device is definitely worth its value and time.

the only negative I have is that you have to connect the dot to the power source. I wish dot comes with an in-built battery backup and it could work for a few hours without the continuous power supply.",4.4
1380,"This girl rocks.

Although I've been an impulsive buyer and owned 2 or 3 stereo music players over the last few years, nothing has impressed my family like this ""pav-bhaji"".

My mom liked old songs, especially in our local language and it is hard to find them in retail market. And in comes this girl. I taught the basics to my mom and now she gets most of her favourite songs by just naming them!

Her additional function of playing an assistant is also cool, from reading out the news, telling the time, setting reminders/alarms/timers, notes, making grocery lists, cooking recipes, and answering general questions; she is for keeps.

Thanks Amazon, for introducing my family to the smart life. We are getting lazy :D

Point to note... All these services are enjoyed if you are an Amazon Prime customer. Once that is deactivated, you will not be able to get or save playlists or play a single song at Amazon music. You might however be able to access Saavn for music. So, Amazon hooked you.",4.4
1381,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.
1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.
2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot
3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.

I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now",4.4
1382,"Great product. Bought aprox. one month ago. We desired variety of songs in Hindi, Telugu and it played all of them immediately with out taking time. It answered variety of questions. I am enjoying the company with the songs as per my desire and with answers for my questions. My wife and my daughter are also happy with this product. May be I am enjoying because of my prime membership as most of the songs it picked from prime music and very few from saawn. Even we are asking alexa the time, when we wake in between nights.",4.4
1383,I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.,4.4
1384,"Got it two day back all new Eco dot 3rd generation. Need to say its superb device.
Superb Sound. I was thinking to buy  bluetooth speaker for eco dot thinking that it may not have enough sound and quality. But thanks to Amazon, did superb Job.
It has four mic and listen your commands very well from far away  and i can say it is picking command nicley from approx each corner of say 450-500 square feet room.
It has max volume to 10 level and able to listen upto 6-7 level of music. In high volume, little difficult to listen your voice which is due to high volume of music. But if you are sitting close to Device, you can use button on device to give command.
Nice and Compact Design as well.
Tried doing few activity like plying music, adding task, adding reminders, weather forcast, news etc . All done nicley.
Two great thing I like about is that device very well recognise the voice and you can do next song, fast forward, adding song to favorite list, like or dislike the songs, create play list. And second thing is like adding activities to task and adding reminders, actually in normal course, or doing some activity, you sometime remember something or want to add something to to-do list or say monthly shopping list, but what happened when you sit to prepare that list of stuff you need ot task to do, you forget that stuff or activity. With the help of this device, you can add that stuff immediately when it get  striked to you so that at last moment you need not spend time on remember that stuff.
Lastly need to say, it can be a superb personal assistant.
Ill rate 4.5 Stars, next update on eco dot , amazon can think of wireless Eco Dot, so we can carry here and there. Currently user need to place it always near power point, which may not be the desired location and second improvement i recommend is to have wall hanging/ wall mount option. Because I personally want to hang in middle between my bedroom and drawing room so that i can gibe command from either side. Third Improvement can be wireless charging. These three improvement make it must buy although still its a must buy.
Superb Job Amazon.",4.4
1385,"I had IR controlled devices in my house. I installed echo Dot and Oakter controller and achieved infinite control of my home devices. Now I just call out, "" Alexa switch on light one and my light comes on"". It's easy to install. You get held up during installation but Amazon has given explanations for specific problems. Plus there is some thing called skill set which gives the eco dot infinite skills. I was able to cast music from my echo dot to my hometheater by blue tooth. Although I can do it by the line out. But I was interested in doing that by Bluetooth",4.4
1386,"Amazon Echo dot (3rd Gen) really rocks:
The following are the pro's and con's:
1. The 4 mics are very sensitive and is picking up the voice commands even from my 3 yr old daughter without any glitch and even from a far distance, my entire family is enjoying a lot. You just name it, and Alexa in echo dot is ready with the answers. The accuracy of the answers range between ~80 to 100%.
2. The sound output is crystal clear with all the high notes, mid range and even the low notes (bass) equally balanced and is just awesome to listen to music.
3. Connecting to WiFi network is as easy as a knife through a butter, but connecting to your own mobiles WiFi hotspot is really a bit cumbersome as another mobile with WiFi hotspot is needed only if you are unable to connect echo dot to any WiFi networks during first installation as echo dot gets an update (updates regarding the mobile hotspot) as soon as you connect to WiFi network for the first time.
4. The Bluetooth can easily be setup by the ""Pair"" voice command.
5. The output from the 3.5mm jack is also awesome when connected to an external speakers with amplifier.
A must in every house. I'll update the review after a week of usage.",4.4
1387,"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.
The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.
I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.
At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.",4.4
1388,"I was in doubt while choosing between Google home mini and Echo dot but my inclination towards Amazon as a prime member and my investment into Amazon eco-system made me convinced that I should choose alexa over the other.
Packaging was very good and it contained the Echo dot and and its proprietary charger.
The Echo dot is built well with its mesh fabric design which looks good. It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.
Set-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.
Sound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene. I can stream high quality music from Amazon music being a prime member to my sound system and have added convenience of a smart speaker. You can find good deals and bundles at festivities if you are planning to purchase it.",4.4

It‚Äôs a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)",4.4
1392,"I will first give the steps to connect succesfully; for a brief general performance review, you may scroll down please.

To successfully pair your phone, wifi and echo:
1. Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.

2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.

3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.

4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.

5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.

As for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.
The bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.
Echo plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.
You cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.

I hope this helps. Peace'o & cheerios folks :)",4.4

My Mom and Dad (not tech- friendly) likes this device that is surprising for me as they see this as a single device, alternate for Radio, News channel, assistant, music player and fun.",4.4
1394,"Pre ordered the item and was delivered by Sunday. If the packing was impressive by Amazon, the setting up Alexa was even more. Very easy to set up and without any hassle-be it WiFi, Bluetooth speakers or operate smart gadgets.Understands Indian English without any problem and answers anything from science mathematics politics countries etc referring Wikipedia. Plays so many songs from Amazon Music as well as from Saavan. I was stunned to hear soundtrack version of old ones like Sound of Music , Abba to latest Lady Gaga. About Hindi....wow any song from Md Rafi, Kishore to latest. Plays any online FM radio in Tune in in all Indian languages and English. Right now it can translate English to Hindi or any international language. May be more Indian languages added soon.I was shocked with joy when Alexa was able to tell the Malayalam movie running in Chennai with PVR multiplex name when asked to name the Malayalm movie running in Chennai.I tried different Bluetooth speakers like Bose Boat or Philips and pairs like a charm.Create your play list in Amazon Music or Saavan and play. Regarding the placement of Echo, try keeping a little above from the floor . It will enhance the bass several times and also fill the room to sound great. Please see my photo for that.

1395,"I was pretty confused between google home mini and this one. So decided to give it a try first.

I planned to return it back once I feel like I am not that impress. But guess what, once I had hands-on, I felt like I am never gonna find any con here. I just configured everything and started using it right there.

Topmost and most imp - Music quality is highly impressive. I am already done with those excessive bassy audio equipment that I have in my home - Sony 5.1 Home theatre and a jbl charge 2+.
Bass is cool but its not so cool when it comes to playing music all day long. And this echo dot fulfilled the purpose. Bass is pretty decent and mids and highs are quite crisp. It clearly sounds like some expensive device. Besides, it plays by itself. so your phone doesnt stay occupied.

It is smart enough in thousands of skills that now I dont have a second thought of returning it.
I purchased wipro bulb combo at 2300.
One of the best feature here is broadcasting. I dont like making phone calls once I am outside. Alexa app allows me to type a broadcast message and send it to my home just with few clicks.
Futuere is here guys. Give it a try. All good so far.",4.4
1396,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)",4.4

1398,"Well I bought Alexa on 19th May and writing this review on 19 th June.. so far my experience with Alexa is as below .
All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome, it is batter then Google Home in terms of connecting your Smart TV. It is even batter in understanding your requirement. Pros and Cons as per my 30 days usage along with Google Home is as below.
Pros.
1) Looks very decent
2) Buttons are on TOP so you will not press any button mistakenly while moving your eco dot.
3) Lights are on side and in all direction, so it is easy to view that Eco dot is taking your command.
4) As per my observation, Speaker and Mike are not the same, as It takes your command from quite a distance even though speaker volume is set to 3 or 4.
5) You can give command from almost 10 feet with your normal voice, you need not to shout or need not to raise your voice to give command
6) Connect Smart TV very easily ( I have connected my SONY Bravia 55'' X8200 E Smart TV )
7) You can change volume and change Channels by simply saying channel number or name "" Alexa change channel to Star Movies HD "" or "" Alexa Next channel"" or Alexa change channel to 251"" and ""Alexa increase / Decrease volume to 50% on my TV"" ""Alexa Switch on my TV"", "" Alexa Switch off my TV""
8) Sound quality is very good.
9) You can connect external home theater speakers with it with help of RCA adapter cable.
10) Can pronounce your name in Indian Accent
11) It has a very good collection of songs, so you can enjoy the songs as per your mood and day night situations.
12) It was not understanding hindi before but now Alexa can understand little hindi too.
13) Last but not least, It gives detailed answer for your questions or queries or it can tell even your horoscope or your favorite recipe, It can play radio FM, distance, book cab, book Food, add things to your Amazon cart and many more.. and More...

Cons.
1) It has a room of improvement
2) Still baby and learning many things, so don't expect answer for all your questions
3) Still can do very limited after connected to Smart TV, it can not open Applications like you tube or Sony liv, Hotstar, Zee5. So you have to depend on your TV remote for this.
4) The biggest limitation is, It has to be connected to power plug and socket, you can not take it in your CAR ( You can take Google home in your car or you can connect Google home anywhere as Google home has power connector same as Mobile phones)
5) It can not understand many Indian words, like I tried "" Alexa Riston me darar aai by Jagjit singh ) it never understood it while Google home can even understand one word like "" Hey Google riston me darar aai""
6) You still can not call on mobile, can't send SMS.",4.4
1399,"This is unfair. You make people buy at higher prices and then bring in a special price for two days wherein you discount it heavily with an add on product for free. I paid 2800 Approx for just the Echo Dot, after waiting for a discounted price like the one in January wherein I received Echodot with Oakter. Now ofcourse at 2299/- you are offering echodot with light bulb, which beats both the purchases made by me.

I think I deserve a wipro bulb for being a faithful customer..",4.4
1400,"Product was received as described and received the product before time than expected. The sound quality is really nice and tried automating various household appliances with the help of Broadlink Pro and works very will like TV, AC, Music System etc.

Cons:
If you are playing a song on full volume then Alexa doesn't respond and you need to use the mobile app to stop the music or need to use manual command button available on echo dot.",4.4
1401,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.
1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.
2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.
3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).
4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.
5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.
6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.
7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360¬∞ view.
8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.
9. Can fit into confined space.
10. Also paid only ‚Çπ1999.
What more one can ask for.",4.4
1402,What an amazing product? A must have for all home. Spend some more money in the smart home accessories and you can use its full power. At its price point it is the best speaker available in the market. However if you have any costly speaker system in your home connect it wirelessly . I use my BOSE speaker system quite seamlessly.,4.4
1403,"I would look out for a book like Alexa for dummies.
Too smart device. It's functionalities can be endless, one should know how to leverage them.
Sound quality is good.
I like the way. The devices gets ready and sharp to hear as if with ears !! once you call out ALEXA.
Sarcastically told my wife, u never allowed a dog to enter the house. here comes the smart bitch.üòâ",4.4
1404,"In a word... Just fabulous...
Not that much works in queries like Google. But GK level is quite good.
For music it's outstanding.
Voice recognition, sound quality, the LED ring ... All experiences are just awesome.
Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.
But After all these ifs & buts... Me & my family members like it very much..",4.4
1405,"I'm a tech-savvy guy, I own both Google Home Mini & Echo Dot 3rd gen.
Bought this on Great Indian sale for just 2999/- only.

Reviewing it after 2 weeks of using it.

Okay, my first thought was how much Alexa is suitable for the Indian Audience. Ans? Totally worth it.
Setting up Alexa using the Alexa app is critical not that tough if you know what features/skills you want to use on Alexa.

Alexa can recognize Indian accent very much like Google Assistant. Shocked? You better be, that the beauty.
The sound? More than enough. It beats its rival Google Home mini in this aspect.
Do you need to have a Prime subscription?
This again depends on your need, currently, I'm using Alexa & FireTV without any prime subscription. Just change the streaming services to saavn if the music is your 1st priority.

Alexa is much more like Family device it responds to everyone's voice. That's a disadvantage too.
I found it better in many aspects than google home mini.
Alexa can read ebooks from your Kindle account, audiobooks from audible. That pretty impressive.
There are a lot other cool things that Alexa can do which I can't cover here.

Alexa Echo Dot Advantages:
Play music loud.
Can respond to your queries very well.
Somewhat close to Google Home mini in terms of being a virtual assistant.
Create to-do lists(not available on Google Assistance).
Shop from Amazon Pantry.

Disadvantages:
Not as good as google assistance in doing continued conversation.
It does not support gaana app
Alexa responds to everyone even strangers, unlike Google Home which is limited users.

Alexa is one of the must buy smart home gadgets that one should get.",4.4
1406,"One of my best purchases so far from Amazon . I purchased this product after going through a lot of reviews and researches . At one point is was almost convinced to buy the Google Home mini ,but eventual decided to buy the Amazon Echo dot 3rd Gen , after finding out that it has modified itself to understand Indian ascent. So here are the pros and cons after 1 month of usage

PROS-
Smooth Installation
Get the Alexa app at your cell phone and installation is smooth and easy
Connecting to the wifi is ok - at first it took a while , but then it was smooth
Connecting to a blue tooth device is really fast
Lovely sound quality and is decent enough for a big sized room.
Can play almost any song (i tried , hindi , eng and of course being a Bong i tried all sorts of Bengali songs)
Yes it plays maximum songs from Amazon Music , and then goes to Sawan or other music libraries too.
Language can be set as English and Hindi
One can set reminders , play quiz, it can make animal sounds , ask about weather conditions and forecast , in fact it can answer most of your queries .(its a best fried of my 1 year old son)
If you have a smart light , you can even set to turn on/off the light (in my case i got the Wipro smart led bundled as free)

CONS
Have to admit that the search option has to be updated a little , in case of little difficult things it cant search its library and ans
Cant play songs from YouTube (obviously copyright issue )
Its always plug and play , it doesn't have a battery . Makes it a little difficult to carry , cos it requires electric plug-ins (unlike portable Bluetooth speakers )

over all its a great buy , barring few negative things which obviously can be ignored
and what makes it more amazing is that i got it at 40% discount during the GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL",4.4
1407,"Very good product at reasonable price
1. Mic sensing very good
2. Third Gen Echo Dot very good in sound quality
3. Nice and Compact Design

when comparing to google home mini its pretty good quality wise",4.4
1408,"Got it for my mum who is semi paralyzed and can't move much. She now calls me by voice command and listens to her favorite music and the holy Bible.
Also have ordered for a smart bulb that she can control with her voice.
Its so simple and even a senior citizen can use it. Truly amazing.",4.4
1409,"Fantastic product and this is my 1st echo series. Alexa understands and improves as a conversation tool for kids at home.
the sound quality is great for a small speaker , sets up very easily to your amazon prime account, also plays shortlisted in your amazon music account.
i ham yet to try to connecting with my Yamaha amplifiers and finding the same difficult as Bluetooth receiver is not pairing. i am yet to try with my LeeEco smart TV, as i don't feel the necessity. Best to make this work as a independent unit and as a companion when you don't want to switch the home theater system, TV, Etc.
for this price and functionality alexa does great work and take this as only a speaker with some smart sense, WOw product.",4.4
1410,"Excellent for lazies and always in action persons. Alexa reminds everything everyday every minute. Sometimes we mostly forget our scheduled tasks. Like pills, matches, shopping, things to remind. Alexa is everywhere where has internet.i m really amazed was going to buy Google mini but compare to this luxurious Google mini no match for look or sound. And Alexa is getting better everyday but not match for Google. Who wanna reminders alerts, songs, sound quality and looks go for this. Google take voice commands better. But Alexa also does everything I need 100%.",4.4
1411,"I just got my new pair of echo dot speakers. I have set them up as a stereo pair on my work-from-home desk. Listening to music on Spotify is a pleasure. Rich, full sound. I don't feel the lack of bass. I also have an older echo dot from 2018 in my bedroom -- the 2020 ones have much richer sound.",4.4
1412,"Got a sweet prime day combo deal on this and this is my second purchase of this device. For the price and the ease of use and integration, I am very happy with it. I only wish it had a chargeable feature to go alongside it to make it truly portable but I guess Amazon has other devices which cater to that need.

I really haven't used the offerings from google and apple in this category so will not compare but just for itself, this device is a charm.",4.4
1413,"Sidhi si bat he iska pure use to sirf jo total sirf computer job vale hi kar shakte he baki to sab sholh k liye lete he,baki normal speakers ki tarah hi use hoga sound limited he ek room k hisab se, baki special search nahi karta kuchh only Amazon, Amazon prime music ,hungama,jese 3 se 5 platforms ko hi use karta he,baki puchho ge to javab milega iske bare me mobile app m jaye ,bss baki shokh pura karo baki naya kuchh nahi lagega",4.4
1414,"It's totally Paisa wasool
Speaker is loud
She listen well to your command
I'm amazed with it music quality even when paired with mobile it plays loud but struggling to make a call
Happpy me !",4.4
1415,"At first i was confused which one to buy - Google home mini or Echo dot. After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.

Pros:

1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.
2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.
3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.
4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.
5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.

Cons:

1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)
2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)
So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.",4.4
1416,"BEFORE PURCHASE IT WAS NOT CLEAR WHETHER I NEED 2 MOBILES OR 1 LAPTOP OR 1 PC TO INSTAL .I HAVE BEEN TRYING TO INSTAL SINCE 3 DAYS USING MY 2 MOBILES.... ALSO WITH THE HELP OF ECO DOT TEAM.... BUT NOT ABLE TO SETUP....MY MOBILE FAILED TO DETECT THE DEVICE. FEW ECO TEAM ARE NOT TRAINED WELL TO HELP IN INSTALLATION.
MADE VERY COMPLICATED TO INSTAL. THE TEAM IS ASKING ME TO INSTAL THROUGH LAPTOP OR PC.. It can be installed with one mobile. Suggestions for improvement in hardware : The 4 buttons on the Echo should made ro glow with LED. Now you have to search buttons using a torch or mobile torch . All the programs in Menu Skill & Games should be pre-enabled, it's hectic to enable more than 75 programs/functions. User can disable what is not required.",4.4
1417,"Verdict
-While the previous Echo Dots were cheap ways to extend smart home control all over your home, they weren't the most attractive devices and had weedy sounds. Bought it on tha second day of Prime day in a combo
-The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a vast improvement on the originals, even though it costs exactly the same.
-The new finish looks fantastic and the new Echo Dot is a device that you'd happily put out on show. Audio has been dramatically improved, too, both in terms of quality and loudness, which makes Alexa easier to understand and means that the odd bit of music or radio is a possibility.
-If you're looking to put Alexa in more rooms, then this is the device to buy.

Pros
-Clear and loud audio
-3.5mm and Bluetooth audio outputs
-Same price as old model
-Improved design

Cons
-No longer USB-powered
-Not ideal for music",4.4
1418,"First of all don't even compare it to google dot. That thing will take ages to catch up to the tailor-made experience of Amazon echo dot for India.
Now being a smart speaker this thing is not like a regular bluetooth speaker which is used to play your music but it's an interactive device which works on your voice command(or the app). Playing music is just one of its features and it can do a lot of other things for you. Infact it's learning to do new skills everyday. You can control your electronics (lights, t.v., or any other device connected to smart plug) , set up cameras, play games, quizzes, order food, do calculations, listen to radio, ask the questions of general knowledge or any other random information that you want.
The sound is more than perfect for a mid size room but you can always connect it to another speaker. I have connected mine to the UE Boom 2 and the resulting sound quality is just amazing.
It obviously takes time and investment to reap all the benefits of this tiny device but for sure this little dot will change the way you live in an amazing way.",4.4
1419,"I have a Google Home (her name is RoseDay) and Echo Dot (paired with Alexa) is the new Lady at home.
RoseDay is a little Smarter, but Alexa isn't far behind. I have kept Alexa running non stop for a week while we were away for a tour abroad, and i must say, she has done a good job with the tasks assigned to her. . I could control her remotely from my mobile from 1000s of KM away and was able to watch her switch on our smart lights, show us our house using smart CCTV Cameras, play songs at home at random times(i do it just to give a feeling that people are at home even when away). Alexa packs more features for the Echo Dot than RoseDay (google home). I purchased two Alexa's (as if one wasn't enough) and gifted one to my mom who stays at a different place than we do, so she could speak to my daugther just using the Echo dots.

Overall, Alexa (Echo Dot) is one (talkative) little lady of your choice, that your wife will be happily willing to accept to be home.",4.4
1420,"Amazon Echo Dot ticks all the boxes, except it's sound quality. It's extremely powerful, smart and agile. The effort by the engineer's at Amazon shows. They have done a painstaking job to perfect Alexa. Microphones are powerful (Alexa even acted upon a request to play party music from a TV commercial!!). The sound quality needs to be worked upon. It's just not there. Considering that most of my requests are to play music, it needs to be crystal clear. It's not that small speakers can't sound good. JBL, for instance, sounds great even in its basic version. I had to invest in an extra Bluetooth speaker to make up the deficiency on the sound quality front ( Ultimate Ears Wonderboom costing Rs 4 k). Incidentally, I had a tough time searching for a compatible Bluetooth speaker as Amazon has not released any list of Echo Dot compatible speakers. I had made a call to Echo support and even the support executive could not help me. Finally after two cancellations, I hit upon Wonderboom, which is terrific with the Echo Dot.",4.4
1421,"Alexa vs Google home

Alexa has a very good speakers.
Google has a average speakers.

Alexa can recognize voice from anywhere in the corner of a 1600 sq ft house.
Google finds it difficult in one go. Need multiple attempt.

Alexa can play exactly the same music you ask for since it plays from Amazon music.
Google home can be linked with spotify, you tube music and multiple songs app so it plays which is easy for itüòÉ.

Alexa can catch exact voice and words.
Google takes multiple attempt.

Both needs power connectivity all the time when you use.

Both works on same concepts.

Google home is better option only cause it connects YouTube. Youtube premium is not needed.

Alexa is a better option if you are ok with the contents of Amazon music and other apps except YouTube.",4.4
1422,"Overall a good product with lots of skills that u can add. Easy to install and start and looks so perfect. It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.",4.4
1423,"This is my second Alexa device , way better from first generation . Sound quality also good . Just got hang once since last two months .

I was confused with nest and this because both are selling at almost same price but sound wise this one is much better and if you're confused with digital clokc or 4th generation then my suggestion is no need to spend more than 2500‚Çπ on this devices after sometime you hardly use them or spot any difference from highend version .",4.4
1424,"New edited review:
The issue mentioned below was again seen in new device and then i figured out i had not removed the plastic strips that covered the mic! Amazon should put a note asking users to remove it before use! This was obstructing my commands. All ok now.

Old Review:
It took a lot if issues while setting up with app. Luckily am tech savvy so figured out.. also - It doesnt register any commands while giving an output. So if i ask it to play a song it will but when its playing a song i ask to stop or go to next it doesn't register the command and i have to manually hit the action button to give a command. Have ordered a replacement. Fingers crossed for the next piece",4.4
1425,"Being a music lover, I already have speakers from JBL till zebronics and I can say that this Echo dot is having a very good sound quality and bass and one should buy this if he/she is planning to buy a new bluetooth speakers and for those who already have bluetooth speakers can step away, reason, this smart device is definitely good but as we all have andriod or apple phones these days which has integrated feature of 'Ok Google' and 'Siri' you can use that for controlling things and I personally didn't find this device that useful, also sometimes it misses your command and start Playing music or gives information which we didn't asked for, also this device need continuous electric supply which means it has to be plugged in whole day and needs continuous Internet as well, I guess Amazon will work on this and bring devices with batttery backup support, so over all I liked this device but not that useful....",4.4
1426,"Overall product is very good. I really loved it.
But, I returned this product because it's ""Made in China"".
I proud to be Indian and I respect my country and our soldiers.
If Amazon can give me choice to buy same product made in different country, then I will surely buy it again.",4.4
1427,"I read a number of reviews where people trying to connect it to their phone hotspot are not able to. The solution is to in reading the instructions carefully. If you want to connect to a hotspot don't select the phones WiFi network during setup on alexa app. There is a separate option at the bottom (where the wifi networks are listed) to connect to the phone hotspot. Next, in the hotspot settings of your phone check that you have allowed unknown devices to connect. For example, in Samsung phones by default it allows only known devices to be connect to the the hotspot. Turn off the setting and Echo will connect to the phones hotspot. I have two wifi networks configured for my echo. If my first network goes down, Echo switches to my phone hotspot easily. Just read the setup instructions carefully.

I bought it for automation and multiroom music streaming. It fulfills the purpose to a large extent. However, I feel that Amazon should have given more granular control of volume. The 10 level volume doesn't give you much control and sometimes going from (say) level 7 to level 8 is too much of a jump. Secondly, the volume of alexa and the connected speaker doesn't sync. Each has to be adjusted independently. In Samsung phones you have the option to bind the phone volume and speaker volume. This sort of function should be there. Apart from this, the third party development and support for the connectedness devices is excellent and I feel it'll trump Google home in some time. That ways I can see it as a much more future proof bet.",4.4
1428,"We purchased Gen3. The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings. App has a very poor design and functionality. Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker. Overall, good to hear music. AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions. Good for wakeup alarms and listening music. Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown. Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify. Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube. Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb. These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt.",4.4
1429,"So I wanted a device to control my smart home devices via my voice so I bought the echo do, I got a really good deal as I paid just 3.6k for it (The actual retail price is 4.5k).
So i v already owned an Alexa for a while .
And there are a lot of things that it can do but it also lacks in some places .

Pro's:
1. Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).
2.pretty loud for the sound .
3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.
4.robust design .
5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .

Cons:
1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.
2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.
3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .
4. Heats up a bit on the top .
5.wifi coverage isn't the best .
Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.
Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features",4.4
1430,"Overall good product. With double offer it was reasonably priced. Good voice recognition. The sound and it's quality could have been slightly better. However I feel only people with Amazon prime will benefit from the Amazon music. Otherwise I'm not aware of any other way of listening to music as of now. Pandora is not available in India. It may play from web? Not sure of that.There is an option on asking for a radio station where it tunes and plays songs from it. Did not try and the video was American. Voice recognition is spot on. With Amazon prime there is option to shop online through alexa, good list of songs such that u can say a song name or artist and Alexa will play. Intelligent enough ai that I felt like iron Man talking to Jarvis.",4.4
1431,"Upgraded from 2nd to 3rd Gen dot, must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally. While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:
1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music
2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)
3. Spotify not available ""yet""
4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons
5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.

Summary:
If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.",4.4
1432,"If you‚Äôre in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you ‚Äì even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback.",4.4
1433,"Hello,
I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.

Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.

Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.

So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or Google
If you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.

But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.
If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference.",4.4
1434,"Love you so much Amazon! You do have a place in my heart! My echo dot audio went bad in a few months of minor usage(blurry voice). Pinged amazon cc about the issue and they replaced with a new device in a few days. Hassle-free service!

when it comes to device,
not that smart. Alexa is not very friendly some times. Does not answer all my queries. and Alexa is not letting me emotionally attached to her. ""Alexa, will you be with me forever"" -> ""Alexa: I don't know that one"" :(

I am unable to teach anything to alexa, it is very limited. MAde in china, looks like they are saving a lot on this device. Had the first replacement in couple of months smiled usage. Lets see.",4.4

 $$$ Awesome Bluetooth Speaker with AI.Value for money ,got it during sale of Rs2999/-. Playing songs via JioSavan and Gaana app and sound that comes out from this Small echo dot 3rd Gen üîä was Bombastic for a small room , but playing songs through Mobile via Bluetooth is not giving that much of clear sound of songs some sort of Treble sound is missing but awesome with Gaan app and Jiosaavan app. Regarding Amazon Alexa AI sometimes not triggered I have to say 2X or 3X Alexa then Alexa respond to our voice , I think Amazon have to continue to Use concept of 7 microphones instead of 4 microphone which was in Echo dot 2nd Generation. Negative part of this Echo dot 3rd is it has circular plugin port to echo dot which should be usb 2.0 which 2nd Gen echo dot have plus point here. I think Amazon should change this Power Plugin port to normal USB 2.0 so that we can connect our Smartphone charger cables to it and connect it to any Power bank. One Con is that anyone who knows how to trigger Alexa in your absence your neighbours and their children's can operate Alexa to play something or if you have smart plugs connected to Alex a theybeasily can turn On and turn Off lights.",4.4

The bluetooth connectivity is no good. it's very difficult to connect to any other bluetooth device. Now coming to the main part of the Echo : voice recognition or rather would say it's integration. The Indian voice is a disaster. Half of the time you will have to repeat even for the simpler terms and words. Half disappointed, else it's good.",4.4
1440,"Hi guys if u have Wi-Fi in your house only than... Buy it or else.... U need to use your phones hotspot and connect .... And one.... More thing is u need to plug it everytime u can't take it and roam lik other Bluetooth... Speaker's..... These are cons of this, I hope Amazon bring solution for.... This.. ,,, rest everything is fine...",4.4
1441,"Received in perfect condition, came with free Wipro smart bulb. We're in love with this Alexa device, voice recognition is good, no installation required. Just connect to a plug, install the Alexa app and you're all set up. The smart bulb is truely a wonderful bonus. We enjoy switching on of off the light bulb by voice. Only 1 downside is I can't connect it with my laptop. Would be fun to listen music and watch Youtube or videos in using the speaker. Though I installed the Alexa app on my laptop it won't play Amazon Music or Prime Videos.",4.4
1442,"Great service at a great price. Thank you Amazon.
The voice recognition is pretty good. But for this price you get a speaker quality which is decent. Not really so great. You can take it around with you wherever you go. We like to keep it in the hall which is large but it works power pretty well and covers the whole hall. The volume is loud enough for a big room for sure.",4.4
1443,"Pros: Sound quality is good, hardware and design makes perfect fit.. Hardware quality worth for the money. Automation works well like switching on the light and other stuffs.
Cons: Software not upto the par. Apart from Amazon music, other apps like spotify, gaana are not supported upto the mark. Also, tamil and local news are not supported. If you wanna use it for only songs (via amazon music), then I would prefer. So integration needs improvement.",4.4
1444,Used this device for about a couple days now and so far I've observed it can play any English song you ask pretty easy but when asked about a hindi song it either plays a wrong song or it can't understand. Hence asked Alexa to change her language to indian English and Hindi. Now the accent and voice is of a Indian lady and not the original US English accent but still face difficulty in getting it to play the hindi songs I request. But I guess it will learn to recognise my words slowly. Although it's a wonderful device with many uses but it needs to work on getting the right hindi songs.,4.4
1445,"I have always been a fan of virtual assistants. So when there was amazing offer which gave me e the echo dot along with the syska smart bulb for under 3000 rupees I went for it. Initial impressions it works as advertised however I am not sure if the one or two times I use this on a daily basis to turn off the light it is worth the amount I paid. Is not anything else it works as a smart speaker and you can tell Alexa to play songs at the convince of your voice. It's want to talk to Alexa and laugh at funny responses. Alexa isn't as smart as you want it to be and a lot of you questions are responded with ""I don't know that"".

If your locality has a lot of power outages it might be a problem specially sense Alexa takes about a couple of minutes to reconnect if it loses power. It also will not work if you don't have an active internet connection which is a huge bummer. But overall I'm very happy with the purchase and I would recommend others to give it a try as well. I hear some people use it to learn English.",4.4
1446,"Till Now i am so happy with echi dot 3.

It do all basic task like
Seting Timer,Clock,playing Music from amazon music or savan,searching from internet,math calculation etc

I Love Its design Very impressive

Some times she automaticaly responce. Lol

So manh Skill are avilable you can activate it from alexa app.",4.4
1447,"The sound quality and Bluetooth connectivity is awesome for such a small device. First and foremost thing to do after buying is to check the marketplace of your Amazon account. If it is global (. com), we have to send request to Amazon help team to change to (.in), otherwise, gaana, jiosaavn or even an android TV bought in india cannot be connected. However, Mostly can't recognize many words and skills in gaana and jio saavn.",4.4
1448,"Skills which I like specifically are:
1. PanchTantra: 100s of Indian stories for kids
2. Mein Tota hare rang ka - Indian Rhyme
3. Haathi Raja Kaha Chale - Indian Rhyme üêò
4. Tamil Kids Story & Songs (Kathai Padalgal) India
5. Indian Rhymes for Kids - Bhola Bachpan (300+rhyme)
6. Wild Animals (Animal Kingdom) - Indian Version
7. Namokar Mantra - Jain Prayer Daily
8. Lord Krishna Meditation - 1 hour Indian Flute

1449,"After 3 months here are the things which I found.

Works better if you have connection of minimum 20 mbps.
I have started to get few bugs or software issue.
Alexa listens sometimes by itself and says, 'sorry, I don't know that.'
Sometimes songs stops playing in middle by itself.
It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.
After command it doesn't follow.
Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.
The sound has decreased, now at volume level 3 I can't hear music properly after 3 meters range. (Have same background noice of fan/Vehicles)

Amazon please send a software update which solves these.

Thanks!",4.4

- First time Connection to WiFi network is headache. You need a separate WiFi network. It don't get your own mobile

- Product is good.Nice sound quality. Good looks. But needs power connection always. Must have provided with a small battery , to support backup while shifting from one power source to other.
- Ask for Amazon Prime membership for some songs.
- Product is a fun toy for Kids of age below 15 years.",4.4
1451,"This is indeed an improvement over the 2nd gen. But, a lot needs to be done in the machine learning part. 8 out of 10 ttimes, it understands but not as good as Google Home. I saw one of the reviewers on here bashing other reviewers saying that most of them don't know about sound quality in speakers. I don't agree with that. I agree with others who say this has a good quality of bass. For the price, you get an AI powered speaker with powerful sound. Go for it. This purchase will not be regretted.",4.4
1452,"Sound quality good
Doesn't make calls to general cell phones, but only one echo dot to other.
Gives information most of the times.
Sometimes she's arrogant but that's still fun.
Noise receiver only with low decimals, other wise you'll have to shout to command her.
All in all just go for it. It's a good experience.",4.4
1453,Product was good but it was only for few months? After 1 year as warranty expired it stopped working suddenly and not even showing power sign or a blink. No idea how to get it repaired. Any option for trade-in for this please let me know,4.4
1454,"Purchase on prime day
1black+1silver+1smart light=3999/
Echo dot 5- 5300/

Quality top notch
Sound could be better,and bass was medium.
Filled a room of 12*12 feed with great sound.
Alexa will recognise your words mostly 80%.
As i had 2 speakers iam using multi mode to connect 2 at a time.
Can play all content via bluetooth.
Addition of a battery would ve better..
Charger provided was long and good quality.
Some times sperker shows offline even if ur connected to a network.

Fixing of alexa bugs and the voice requests will be a plus for the speakers.

Will recommend if ur buying at 2300 range.",4.4
1455,"Edit after using for one month.
Initially I had hurdles in getting it to wake with our wake word. Due to less sensitive mic than its predecessor. But had received instructions from Amazon team to factory reset my device, following which the performance is better.
Giving four stars... as opposed to one star earlier.
(Original review) Disappointed with 3rd Gen ... Switched back to old Echo Dot
I was very happy with Echo Dot old version plastic black one with only concern being speaker volume is limited. Brought this one 3rd Gen and found its voice recognition to be very bad than its predecessor. Often I had to shout to make it listen giving rise to a lot of nuisance to others around and throat pain. Also its sound was very Bassy...
Overall I was very disappointed and switched back to my good old Echo Dot 2nd gen.",4.4
1456,"[1 & 1/2 months Review] Sound i
Quality(Bass, Treble, mids) are awesome for Music. Has no connection issues whatsoever. But is a terrible let down if looking for smart capabilities , mostly coz Alexa isn't as smart or conversive like the Google assistant. It's a smart speaker which isn't really smart. If your looking for music only that then go ahead,but then if your only looking for music go in for JBL or other Bluetooth speakers. Else go for Google home mini. Had to spend a lot of time making Alexa smart with combination of autovoice and tasker",4.4
1457,"Play Video
 I have been 2 weeks since I am using it. I am fun using this device. Alexa is like part of our family. Even my grandmom enjoys it. Mostly I am using it for playing music. It is able to play almost all songs. It would be great if we are able to play youtube videos also. Looking forward to exploring more abilities. Hope amazon guys add more skills like compatibility with youtube and gaana.

The sound is good in a room. Alexa can hear you from some distance also. Though there are issues while hearing when it's playing on full volume.",4.4
1458,"This is the first Echo I have owned. So far I am loving everything that it does from to do lists to news updates and linking my calendar to playing music. It is very convenient and hopefully in the future I will buy more products for it to control like my thermostat and lights. That being said I am wondering why in the world, it being an amazon product, does it not control my amazon fire stick! This is so fustraiting and I hope that amazon will come out with an update soon that will allow the echo to have this option! It seems like it can literally control everything except for the fire stick. This is why I gave it a 4 out of 5 stars.",4.4
1459,"Pro
+Sound quality is good
+Controll my light perfectly
+Connect with other device easily
*Alexa call is good and usefull
+Wakeup alarm is very very usefull

Need to improve
+ Alexa need to support tamil language for voice comments
+All the mic are on the top only if one or 2 mic in sidewords it will hear better
+Song selection from Alexa is difficult for tamil movie songs",4.4
1460,"I was very confused between google nest & Eco dot because my Tv is Android,but I choose Alexa and I found ,sound quality is far better than google.
But I think google has its own qualities which Alexa cannot reach.
Now I think I cannot live without Alexa.",4.4
1461,There is nothing to dislike in 3 generation Echo Dot ! Everything about it is made to Perfection. The sound output is just splendid and I own Echo Plus and Echo Dot 2 generation. I regret to have bought the 2 generation Dot since the audio output is pathetic and needs a Bose Bluetooth speaker to do justice but in the case of Dot 3 generation the gadget delivers .... Go for it.,4.4
1462,"Enjoyed Alexa and automating some of my household devices. Sometimes Alexa is not responding to Alexa, stop while it responds to other commands. Looks here and there software has bugs. After powering on and off the speaker then echo dot started responding to Alexa stop also.

Another cons is while using 3.5mm jack there is no option to switch to Bluetooth mode of playing music in echo dot

Mic is very receptive were I was able to wake Alexa up from nearby room also..

Overall a good and positive experience buying echo dot",4.4
1463,"A must product for every one as this is a good source for quick information, and music play. The only improvement that is required is chargeable option as it requires direct power supply to function all the time. This particular one does not have clock display. You have to search for echo dot with clock in amazon. And it might cost you 1000 more. But anyways it can tell you current time .
Hence giving 4/5, but still a very nice product to work with.",4.4
1464,"This is very good hardware and speaker. However very much handicapped by amazon on software front. It can not understand your commands 70-80 percentage times and very limited to amazon music and saavn. However you can not use any of good music apps like wynk, gaana, youtube etc.
Also natural language processing is supported in google products but not in this echo.
For example when you say-
1) where is agra - it gives you correct answer.
2) continue with next query like how to reach there ?
Then for 2nd query it doesn't know what to do..
This is just an example but most of the times you will find this issue there.

Then you can not connect with other populer music etc apps. Have to rely on what amazon thinks os good for you.
Amazon music has very limited music base.

So looking forward to get more access and integration with alexa however not have much hope since its already such an old plateform that they would have given support if there were any such plans.",4.4
1465,"I purchased this as a birthday gift for my 7 years old son. Since he don't have siblings so I though it would be a fun experience for him talking to and giving commands to alexa. But to my dismay he only used it for playing music that also only one song after one month of his birthday. ""Alexa please play the flying jat song"". There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart! Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come. The bottomline is that alexa is not that useful as advertised and we tend to lose interest in it very quickly.",4.4
1466,"""My Wife Can't Listen to me, But Alexa Can"" The new echo dot 3rd gen is much better than previous model. I got it at 2700 after all discount and cash back which is again a steal a deal.
Now after using it for 2 months, here is my genuine review which help others future buyers to decide to buy or not to buy this product.
-What I like About This Product.
1. Built Quality is perfect and strong.
2. Sound Quality with balanced bass.
3. Super Voice Detection thanks to 4 Inbuilt mic.
4. Fast Bluetooth connectivity and sync. Process.
5. Calling through Alexa is super fun and easy.
6. Cristal clear voice quality.
7. 3.5mm Audio Jack is again + for this product.
8. Best ecosystem for smart home control.
9. Perfectly work with all Alexa enabled device.
10. Multiple Alarm, Reminder, To-Do List works perfect.
11. Alexa calling is super fun and I really enjoyed this features subject to the other person having account in Alexa.
12. Can create shopping list for you. But can not tell deals and promotions, so be careful and check the offers before placing the order.

What I don't like.
1. Not answer all the questions correctly.
2. Only support English language.
3. Get stuck after turning it on after a long break and I have re-start the device to make connection again which irritate a lot.
4. Answer is not as clear at Google Home mini.
5. Listen only clear english, so if you are Not Good in English then Alexa will irritate you a lot.

Addition details:
I would recommend this device to those who use Alexa enabled device in their home or office..but if you are using Google enabled device then I would not recommend this device.",4.4
1467,"Cons:
1. Cant Line in with aux cable( echo and echo Plus does)
2. Need power and internet all the time.
3. Doesn't answer properly for most of your questions.
4. context less answers
5. Charger is not universal USB connection so you have to carry charger as well
6. Hectic bluetooth connecting
7. Could not automatically connect to previous wifi, you have to do setup every time when you switch between other routers.
8. Less music provider skills (Amazon music and Saavn, Amazon music need prime)
9. Bluetooth range is just about 4/5 meters.
10. Look good but it would become look dirty because of cotton outer layer.

Pros:
1. Voice control
2. Smart home
3. Routines
4. Fire TV Control(not yet released)

It's like ok ok 3k product, I should have given 1 star for device but software inside device worth 4star. So...",4.4
1468,"Its really made the new device compared to the old model, less compatible. It has changed the power port from Standard most common microUSB to a very non-standard one. Which means, portability from one spot in the room to another or taking it to another room has been majorly compromised. Even worse, the power cable is attached permanently, not via a USB socket
M guessing because its a 15W charger, its probably to force users to use the provided charger only",4.4
1469,"All new ECHO DOT THIRD GEN looks compact but the sound quality is amazing for its size. After using it for nearly two weeks the following are it's pros and cons:

PROS:
1. ) Compact and relatively easy to setup.Check out the YouTube videos in case of doubt or look up Product HELP.

2.) Once the product is synchronised with the Alexa app on your mobile ,it retains its memory even if the power fails, though it has no battery back up. Alexa on the cloud retains it's memory. !!

3.) Amazing sound quality for it's size. Good treble and bass.

4.) The new rounded look with fabric finish is pleasing to the eye.

5.) Can be used as an alarm clock and reminder for frequent travelers provided your hotel has free WiFi and good power back up.

CONS :

1.) No battery back up .

2.) Has not been programmed for Indian Railway and bus schedules. Programming, I am told is an ongoing process.",4.4
1470,"Alexa - Good initiative, but lack of knowledgeüßê need more improvement in AIüò¥.

Product Quality - Hardware and appreance are awesomeü§ó. But only works with Power socket, not chargeable oneüòí.

Usage - It connects with your phone easily, it could recognise your voice easily. But it can only answer very easy and familier queations. Appart from that it will always say like ""sorry I don't know that one""üòµ. And each time you need to start conversations by saying Alexa, then only it will start recognise your commend. Within few minutes you will get a headacheü§ï.

Music - When you say Alexa play music, their will play music from Hungama app. Very less collection is there. Especially Tamil songs are very very less. And mostly Alexa not playing the song which you ask. It will play on it's won. ü•¥

Finally - Good initiative from Amazon but needs of improvement. Because it will not working as they describe in the television add. ü§≠",4.4
1471,"me ""Alexa, play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I do not know that""
me ""Alexa, play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I could not find that""
me ""Alexa, play .... "". Alexa ""Sorry, I don't recognize it""

search capabilities of Alexa sucks!! Even when I read out the playlist names as they are on Amazon Music, Alexa can't find those playlists. Alexa know a standard playlists like 90s bollywood, bollywood hits etc., If you are looking for Kannada playlists or for that matter any local language lists, Alexa just does not know...

me ""Alexa, I have feedback"" ""You really suck!!""",4.4
1472,"Alexa is really good but once you start copying someone you loose your originals and same has happened with 3rd generation alexa, the creator has lost his touch by making it a boom box instead more of an assistant she is now lazy wakes up bit late, you need to be bit louder now, and as like Google mini she cannot listen if the volume is above 6 or 7, I have not understood why they copied the Googles harsh sound decibles ( that's why I am not using Google I have) and brought 2 old Alexa and now 2 new Alexa even the earlier Alexa has become bit lazy may be it's the upgrade for 3rd generation alexa has caused the lazyness. Otherwise Alexa is way superior to Google mini , I request the creator to stick to your own ideas and not to be preconceived with any opinion",4.4
1473,"Very nice product no doubt about it., All in family will be excited about it for a week or more but then the excitement will slowly wade away and coming to the real issue alexa is very poor in integration. Search is not very good and most of the music is from Amazon Music Library and if you do not have Prime membership there is no point in buying this as most of the music is from Amazon music library. I got along with the free wipro wifi led light. It always has doubt when asked to switch the lights on. Good thing is the sound quality is top notch for the device that is so small and alexa can hear your command even 50 mts away in a noisy environment. That is something to cheer about, otherwise it needs a lot of improvement in its search capability.",4.4
1474,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).

On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)

The software front is just average.
If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.
Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.

On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.

I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose.",4.4
1475,"Great Device, I'm still learning what Dot can do. Easy and fun to use, it Tells you everything, bad part it will not play recent news, or live news, more issues while connecting the device from Bluetooth, sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini..some times it says 'can't find it on the web'!!! I think there is a lot of improvement needed ..Need prime membership to play good songs, all songs are not available.... unable to play YouTube...best part of Alexa is that she can set multiple alarms and reminders. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc. Hope Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills...",4.4
1476,"I like Alexa and the features. But rated 3 due to the below facts.

- No inbuilt battery. A big minus. In today's mobile world, you cannot enforce the device to be plugged in always.
- No USB charging facility
- Alexa app is horribly slow
- The moment your wifi connection changes, it cannot detect. You need to reconfigure it

Plus features

- Device shape is great
- Sound quality is superb
- Voice response is awesome",4.4
1477,"Well amazon did a great job they explain every pros on their details
*Only thing is alexa is in beta stage may be it will take some more years for this AI to work like google assistant, because most of the time alexa says "" ‡§Æ‡•Ç‡§ù‡•á ‡§®‡§π‡•Ä ‡§™‡§§‡§æ""
*Interaction in hindi is better than google assistant
*Sould quality is better than my expectations
*Got it on amazon GIF with wipro bulb @2300rs with 100 of cashback ‚úåüèª
* in winter season i don't need to go out from my quilt to switch of my home devices üòÇüòÇ Thanks amazon
* Good for my parents as they can ask most of the things to alexa because they r in a phase of learning smartphones features
* Only buy if u heave a wifi router, will not work good with mobile hot-spot
* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router
* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarter
PS- Add motion sensing LED to ur home with smart LED ... It looks cool and u dont need to shout a lot to turn it off or on and the bottom line is they r more cheaper ‚úåüèª",4.4
1478,"I am returning after trying various commands for about a week. This is a recent review.
Received only 2 days ago. So initial impressions.Not checked integration. Oakremote that I purchased with Echo was a flop.
+ves -Voice recognition , Quick response, Family is having fun giving commands
-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.
I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwaliüòú",4.4
1479,"I have been using the Alexa for about a month now. Following are the reasons for buying or not buying it:

Why buy Alexa?
-New tech, voice assistant feels you powerful.
-Good acoustics. You can hear the songs from anywhere around your home.
-Good for engineering purpose. You may hack it for your own bespoke purpose, for IOT applications.
-Amazing new tech.

Why I don't recommend buying Alexa?
-It works wobbly when it comes to giving voice commands in between an ongoing music or action.
-Does not work with Google Maps.
-Serch engine is poor and limited too.
-More expensive than it's counterpart, Google Home Mini.",4.4
1480,"Hi Future buyer,
Planning to buy this device wud be highly not recommended if u r a noob to this and in case u r running a custom rom on your andriod device.
The App is confusing as much as it can be and force closes if u r not on factory OS, neither will there be any help or nor any reply to your mails from the developer, The setup dint go well and took me to register the product from web based registration.
Otherwise the Product build quality is excellent when compared to the previous one and sound quality is amazing in the new one, Non the less Google home mini still has a better speaker but its hard to differentiate having both at my house side by side,
You r also not to be surprised if u find your router to behave funny when both Alexa and Google home mini are side by side, Its like they r fighting for Bandwidth.
The results are quite slow and takes time for reply when compared to G Home mini.

The LED looks damn good at night and kinda adds upto the entire beauty of the product

Overall if u r someone with good skill set on these things and just want to showoff ur house go for it I wud recommend to buy, others if u r a nood ( Fresher ) go for google home your life will be easy",4.4
1481,"The integration with other app is difficult and many times it unable to perform well with voice recoginition

Flaws:
1.Its difficult to pair it with smart switch and bulbs.i was not successful,in doing so

2.voice recognition sucks
3.the help provided ia not good at all.not a good assistqnt.

4.cannot plqy music or video from yputube
5.no proper help for automating
6.cannot use it as output speaker with my projector

7. Simple automation scripts for pairing should be provided as a sample so that ppl can directly reuse them
8.it only search songs from limited platforms.that huge disappojntment

Not satisfied at all.

Only thing that I like is sound of speaker",4.4
1482,"The right review can not be given. I am using mobile internet. Jio and Airtel are used. But, their internet connectivity and strength are questionable. Therefore, the right review can not be given. However, for music play, it is really attractive and interesting. However, Alexa has to learn a lot before getting five stars. Secondly, Alexa understands English. There are many other features which are not understood by a general user. Thirdly, in order to make a smart home and make Alexa a hub of such a home requires a lot of money. Those features can only be placed under the review when they are arranged.
However, even then, I will recommend to buy it. For 4000 rupees you get good music and less botheration provided the internet strength remain consistence. I feel discouraged when the red line rotates on the device. Even then, buy it and make it a part of your setup.",4.4
1483,"1. Size is small, Looks good in home, material is good
2. It can fill your entire room with good volume of music. Volume vs size of device is really good.
3. Alexa sound is mechanical, we're still 3-4 years earlier for a natural sound of robot in such devices.
4. Can't expect latest GK questions / smart / complicated 2 sentences combined queries, bcoz results are per google search and google can't put logics in queries yet as it's mostly keyword relevance matching. So, overall experience is still mechanical.
5. Music library it connects to are Saavn and it doesn't have good music for night sleep, it keeps repeating it.
6. It blindly plays what the apps give it to play, like, the mood based music search is not good. It sometimes play songs as per direct matching of lyrics with what we spoke but totally not as per intention at all. Such devices totally needs a smarter search engine which understands intention.

Overall small fun device, but I still feel that such devices will take some years to mature and become truly seamless home assistants. But it's for parents and they like it enough :D",4.4
1484,"Well, it certainly does few things but way to go. I don't understand with all the money and talent Amazon has, why they didn't provide simple skill to under stand simple commands like Enter/Select, Go up, Go down etc. so that we can use it proper remote.

Pros:
1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.

2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.

3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.

Cons:
1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.

2. Misses the command now and then.

3. Difficult to give voice command while there are other sounds around like if you are watching TV of listening to music. That's very frustrating as you cannot pause video if sound coming from TV is high.",4.4
1485,"Excellent service provided by the device.. Only problem is with Eco dot 3rd generation device that it‚Äôs only launch an app but never plays a video, especially YouTube.. This feature is a very basic one and should be added with this device which will enhance the product services overall.. Please take it as a consideration. Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV‚Äôs in a single home.. This should be the minimum. I am very much sure, if these two features could be added with this device, it will enhance the overall service of the product and will reach to many other people in India and thus increase the sale of the product..",4.4
1486,"The replacement (exchange) has been delivered without an adaptor, now how is it possible for me to use the device? Remember, I have returned the full set, which includes; the device, adaptor and manual. It is disappointing and I would expect and urge Amazon to take appropriate action.

3. Can't set(bass, treble) different sound profile for conversation and Music
4. Can't set it to recognize your voice means any one(any human being) can command your device
5. Limited search capability than Google mini due to using own search engine",4.4

I finally bought it coz it was on offer during sale and I just wanted to see what the fuss was about and I was right, there‚Äôs nothing great about a smart speaker.

There‚Äôs nothing much you can do with it and the charm & novelty wears off quite soon. More of a gimmick than an actually useful gadget.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the product is good but I really don‚Äôt see its utility. Buy with your own wisdom & utility.",4.4
1490,"No parental controls

We got this as a gift for our child so that she could request her own songs or ask questions
You can label this as the kids room device but it has absolutely no way to configure age of the person who will be using it

I see this as a glaring gap. I believe Google home has it. The Kindle has it. I know Alexa kids edition has been released in the US

But the expectation here is to just allow parental controls to be kept on

First of all you really have to shout to make it heard in a 10/12 room. Secondly, it does what you ask it to do after several attempts. 75% of the time you have to repeat yourself to get what you ask for.

 Works beautifully, have bought 3 to link the entire house. Frequently group and play them together, use drop in to create an intercom, and have linked to speakers, bulbs, TV and other gadgets. I would still give this only 3 stars because it is double the rate here in India compared to the US. A country with 25 TIMES India's per capita income. What is this pricing Amazon? I understand there may be taxes in India but still. 2X the price ?

- Great sound quality, especially considering the price
- Good mic
- The Alexa app makes it very convenient to control the Dot

The HORRIBLE:
I'm unable to connect my Spotify account to the device. People in USA can. I'm giving the product 3 stars in place of 5 only because of this flaw. It's big enough a flaw for me to switch to Google Home instead, even if it isn't as good as the Echo in other aspects.",4.4

1498,"As a first gen amazon echo dot owner, i thought these would improve the overall experience. But the first thing i noticed after setting it up was the bad speech recognition, while the first gen heard me 8 out of 10 times l, the newer one heard me only like 6 out of 10 times!, but the worst part is that the first gen actually did a better job of recognizing my commands and was more polished than this! While the first gen gave me enough time for me to speak, these would just cut me off if i stuttered while the command,.. They wont give the beep echo dot first had while changing volume.
Overall the user experience is downgraded while the build and sound quality improved by a good margin! Hope they will just fix these small issues by just cut n pasting the same echo dot first gen experience or just try to even improve on these unnecessary omissions they made!

If they update it, i would give these a easy 5 stars! Great sound, great build, nicely designed,
Downgraded user experience!",4.4

It's goes not have want I want.",4.4
1500,"What is improved from the earlier generation? My feeling is Amazon need to enrich skills at the backend and ""any generation Alexa"" could use them seamlessly. Also required is the isolation mode - where in Alexa can be configured to do only specific skills rather than responding to noise (conversation not directed for Alexa - e.g. you are referring to Alexander the Great and Alexa in the room starts speaking and disturbing)..",4.4
1501,"No wonder Amazon has tried hard to make this speaker smart but it fails to expect as per the aura which has been built around this product.
At most this is a 'Smart Music Player' and not a smart assistant. The alexa needs to improve a lot. Alexa responds only to simplest of requests and responce in a little twisted scenario goes out for a six.

1. It explains Vocabulary
2. for English and Hindi Songs ( that only specific to jio saavan or amazon music )
Cons
1. It cannot recognize voice with low volume from a distance more than a 1.5 m
2. It cannot Understand and Play many Telugu songs. It only suggests songs which are available on the music app which you have kept default or amazon music.
3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while
4. Changing a Wifi Network takes a lot of time. Every time u need to enter set up mode ( Orange Color light with pressing dot button ). It is better if we can directly change from app.",4.4
1504,"Most important thing is that Google home is like Android phone you can install any software and Amazon echo dot is like apple you will pay for heavy installation charges.
Alexa didn't do anything without help of other software.
Sometimes I feel amazon made echo dot to promote amazon prime membership customer.
so if you want to use Alexa you will purchase Amazon Prime membership and many more so so be ready for investing more money to Alexa after buying Alexa.

1505,"Its a superb product by Amazon. Although it is overpriced product in my view just because basically for music, news etc. We are spending 4.5 K that really not worth as true price for that product would be 2.5 K considering it's good speakers, echo , bass etc. Its good innovation but it is on developing phase because of following:-
1. As many a times Alexa find difficulties to understand our language
2. Not many options available for exploring in music only ganna and savaan is available.
3. The Amazon Alexa app is the worst, as in case Alexa didn't get the song you are willing to listen, so you can't search that particular song on app
4. There is no voice locking system as anybody can change the music by giving command
5. Works well with WiFi only .
6. You have to connect all time with power plug. No other option. So if lights have gone then it's of no use. Biggest disadvantage I guess because we light shortage is biggest problem n we listen to music/news etc. Only when there is no lights .",4.4

Many unnecessary bugs and errors comes by Alexa .
Some pop ups are very irritating .

In this much cost and special discount offer it's worth to buy though and give it a try .",4.4

1509,"They need to provide battery backup so that we can carry it anywhere.

If you are going for meetings I would recommend to go with another product.",4.4
1511,"Overall product is ok. But I'm not happy with the price and Alexa integration. She can recognize your voice from approx 10m of a distance. However, the recommendations/ suggestions provided by Alexa is not satisfactory. I mostly listen to music and the choices she makes are inexact. I mean idk how she come up with lame songs. For example, i have asked for Hollywood songs, she sometimes starts playing bhojpuri songs üòïüòï, additionally i have asked her to repeat what i have asked and she replies the correct sentence, and that's more strange.

Anyways, price comparing to product, price is too high i bought it for 2500 and i would be happy to buy it for approx 1500. But, more than 2000 is unacceptable for Alexa.

Trust me, I regret buying this product. Also, it's not even wireless üôÑüôÑüôÑ. It's app is too heavy which makes it too slow and so on.

1516,"Sadly, I had to return it. It felt like a speaker eventually. Nothing to add, Everything felt very processed, I had to ask Alexa one thing and she keeps replying I don't know that. Its kind of very irritating at times. Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lol

I will start with Cons--
You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.
You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understands
You need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properly
Alexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.
Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.
Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems. BORING
I could have gone on and on but then I returned it as I felt it does practically nothing other than rubbish.

It uses 15 volt power.. while car battery provides 12 volt power.. don't know if the car battery can support the power requirement.. 2). Probably, the power lead that comes with this product is not USB type universal charger that I was expecting from it. 3). I don't think the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.

Amazon probably would add these feature in their next generation.. but I feel cheated as I preferred to have it in the product that I brought.. not that the technology does not exists.. the sad part is that it does.. but corporation like Amazon will like milk their customer dry",4.4
1518,"1. Very high data usage - I have been using Echo Dot through my mobile hotspot, it was working fine until a month back since when it has started to consume huge amount of data over hotspot. Today it consumed around 800 MB while I connected it to my hotspot for around 20 mts and played on songs in that time.I have been facing this issue everyday for almost a month now. All of my data is getting exhausted in trying to operate Echo Dot!
2. Unable to process requests - Since last month it has not been taking commands well, and no matter how clearly you command it plays something else most of the times.

I do not know how to contact product service team/Amazon representatives hence mentioning the issue faced here. Hoping to hear back from concerned representatives.

Regards,
Vikram",4.4
1519,"The feature of Alexa Calling works only with contacts who have the echo devices. In short, you cannot use to call the mobile or phone of your contact list if the other person doesn't own another echo device. This is too absurd and a feature which should be clarified to customers in marketing communication.
The voice recognition and song lists is another area which needs a lot of improvement. Until and unless the song is shared exactly as it is listed with starting words, Alexa doesn't identify it. Also, it does not play My lists in Amazon music. It is a challenge to keep repeating the command with numerous voice modulations and starting point so that Alexa plays the right song. It is a real pain.
In short, in my opinion, Amazon should pay the early users for giving it a learning experience rather than charge money for such half baked product. Amazon is actually using the early users to improve Voice recognition technology and reporting the glitches of the product...",4.4

1. The product is good for listening to random music playing in you room
2. It is shape, size and look are appealing

Dislike:

1. Sound quality is poor, more often than not you find the sound quality muffled.
2. Volume sometimes feels weak, it should have been a bit higher
3. It can used as a Bluetooth speaker for random song playing from your phone but you can‚Äôt use it to listen to audio content like watching an audio clip / series / Netflix etc. in such a scenario the audio is muffled and difficult to comprehend.
4. It‚Äôs plays music from Amazon music which lacks variety in its music. We‚Äôll also know it‚Äôs nothing like YouTube library
5. Finally, when Alexa doesn‚Äôt even understand or comprehend your request, it gets annoying to the next level.
6. Volume is audible in limited space‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre room for example.

Conclusion: it‚Äôs a device good for listening to random music in your room playing constantly in the background while you‚Äôre at your chores.

1521,"I seriously hate saying ""Alexa"" now. Voice recognition is the worst thing I have experienced in this device. I just use this in a small 10x10 room and most of the time I have to repeatedly repeat and repeat or even yell ""Alexa"" to wale the device.
I never expected to get such experience from this device after going through ratings and reviews of the device. I was confused between Google Nest Mini and Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation and only choose this because of AUX output which was really useful feature but just after few hours since I am using this, I am really frustrated with it. I have tried resetting the device and voice training it but nothing helped. It is placed just 2 feet away on bedside table and no noise but it still won't get the word ""Alexa"" or understand most of the time. I have to always repeat myself and speak louder. Far field microphone feature on the device description says it can hear you from across the room. Seriously!!? It cannot even catch the ""Alexa"" word from 2-3 feet away and if its playing music even on low volume then it won't work at all and I have to yell ""Alexa"" many times from a feet or even closed to make it stop.

Even it's Alexa assistance doesn't get me most of the time and just goes dormant without any response.

Very disappointed with it. Going to return it now.",4.4
1522,"The speaker can't be used as a wireless Bluetooth speaker.

It's AUX interface is an audio in only. So unlike the 2nd gen echo or the echo dot, you can neither transfer the audio to a secondary better speaker nor to any headphone or earphone.

It does not have a battery so it always needs to be powered.

The above are serious shortcomings not anticipated from a newer generation device.

Apart from that, the Alexa integration works pretty well and as expected. However Alexa seems far inferior to Apple Siri when it comes to maintaining the context of a conversation.

Overall a nice buy if you wish to experience a voice enabled product that can get a lot of things done. But perhaps not worth the price given the above observed shortcomings.

If any of my observations are inaccurate, please do leave a comment. The views are personal and with no intent to promote or prevent any buying decisions.",4.4
1523,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.

If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.

Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!

I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.

Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked. Clearly, the music that Alexa offers has been selected by Amazon keeping in mind today's teens. And this won't change.",4.4
1524,"I bought this as a productivity tool- during the pandemic while I drift between office work and housework, I need something to remind me of upcoming tasks or meetings. It fails terribly due to lack of thinking by the designers.
1. This devise should require a password or PIN or recognize the voice of the person before proceeding further. It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed.

2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.
3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer. Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results
4. The reminders should have an option to repeat till I turn it off by saying ""acknowledged' or 'done'",4.4

I‚Äôve been using Google Nest and minis and wanted to shift to Echo for its Drop in feature basically .(the full intercom) . It worked fine. But overall Alexa was disappointing.

What takes less than a minute to setup on Google Home it takes over 3-4 minutes on alexa app. I have over 40 smart devices in my home and the time it needed merely setting up those devices was a bummer.

-
they say its better than previous gen. Bit to be honest, its not that good in hearing your voice as 2nd gen do. I am having trouble making it listening.
- led circle light is little dull. I dont like it.
- no great in sound except a 10% increase in bas. Say prev. Gen was having zero bass n its having little bass.
- more asthetic look. I liked it.
- power cable is not usb micro so u cant connect to other power sources. Its having adapter. So u re more on home stuck like to power socket. I am usong 2nd gen in car as well with usb cable.
- bulkier, maybe good for sound n more of in stuff but earlier was more smaller n compact having ligher weight.

Google mini has the brains of the best search engine on earth ! Google mini any day ! Only reason to buy it would be if you had a prime music account and you had to play music through it !",4.4
1529,"Had high hopes for this product after seeing reviews from so many positive feedbacks from customers but was utterly disappointed as it failed to deliver what it's supposed to do.
Voice interaction is utter rubbish as its not able to grasp the Indian slang and finding music through it is a pain.
Content is not that great and integration with Alexa app is not that smooth. Not able to set customized tone for alarm and lots of other drawbacks.
To Sum it all, it's waste of 3500 valuable bucks as there's no easy way to throw it off.",4.4
1530,"Within 3 months of purchasing the sound has begun to distort, even at 5 or 6 level I can here unusual sound. I don't know what to do. My return window is already closed.
Secondly, song searching on Gaana app is very poor. I am very fond of Riya's Retro, but Alexa can search only season 1 and moreover it doesn't recognize different episodes of season 1 either. Means if you have already gone through 4-5 episodes of Riya's Retro and want to listen to the next episode, you have to start from episode 1 and then have to skip the episode you have already gone through. It takes hell lot of time to play the next episode after you give the voice command ""Next"".

AMAZON SHOULD REPLACE MY ECHO DOT.",4.4
1531,"I had very high hope for alexa. Howe it turned out to be disappointment. As speaker it sounds great, no doubt about it. Alexa is far behind from Google home. It can do basic stuff like play music, control smart devices, reminders etc. But it falls flat when you try to lookup information. That's where Google assistant excels. Most of the time alexa would simply respond with I don't know where as Google will find that information. I really wanted to like it but alexa is disappointment and I had to return it.",4.4
1532,"Kind of works, but not enough. Product make and the sound quality are good. Aux-out was a major reason to choose Alexa over G-Home. Basic stuff like alarm/timer etc are okay. But that is it.

Many times the device doesnt listen to me, specially when it is playing music. And I end up calling 'Alexa"" 3-4 times going closer each time to get the 'attention'. If I had to go all the while to the equipment to say 'Next' or 'reduce volume', what is the benefit over any normal music player !
And when it listens, it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time. Initially I thought it is with the regional language (song/movie name), but then found the problem with perfect English dictionary words also (Mercury as Fury and MP3 as MPA). My accent must be really bad !
So basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played.
I did get the PLEX server setup in my PC to stream local music to alexa. Not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet, but atleast I get a playlist of my choice played.

Most of the time I have to use specific commands itself. Natural Language Processing seems far far away. You will need a lot of patience to deal with Alexa !",4.4
1533,"I was very excited about this purchase and very happy that I got delivered one day advanced and I tried setting up Alexa but ended up unsuccessful for almost 6 hours. Then decided to call Customer service I requested for call back on 7.05pm evening and I call from them on 7.06pm which was amazing and prompt service. The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process. I was completely surprised & confused that how come a very big firm like Amazon can deliver a stolen product to their customers and the agent managed to replaceml the product and he gave me end to end service. I was happy with customers service not with Amazon service",4.4
1534,"Expensive, Smart speaker works only when plugged in. Bluetooth V2.0 is very old dur to this audio is very poor, sound becomes very low. No battery to support the speaker so if no power you cannot use the device. Sometimes while song change you hear a distorted sound. Not worth the purchase as Bluetooth quality in the speaker is bad. You need to shout then only Alexa can hear you - voice sensor is poor. On full volume Alexa will not recognise your command.",4.4

#3. Does not at all understand the request / order for songs very well. Needed to ask for the song ""500 miles"" for 6 times before getting the right song. Need to develop a lot.

#5. Does not listens and have no patient.",4.4

* Nice compact sturdy design
* Surprisingly good quality of sound
* Ease of connectivity

Negatives:
* Needs to be connected all the time to power if you need to use it. Not too portable in spite of portable size!!
* Requires subscription to Amazon Prime for most of the features
* Google collects all your likes and dislikes through the use of the device and will know your preferences which is very very scary",4.4

1542,"Looks very nice. Sound quality is good for the size of it. But the major drawback is that it needs to be connected to power source, hence you can't use it anywhere. This should be rechargeable battery powered, otherwise its not on much use if you can't place it wherever you want.

1543,"When I first brought this product I loved this but after 2 months of use I had to reset it as it could not connect to internet and to set-up for 2nd time it took me 2 hours as really could not connect to internet.

The main problem for this device is, if there is no internet then its a dumb box, could not do anything. This is nowhere mentioned in the product description. Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.

Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need. This is irritating most of the times and then I switch to mobile app to play the right song, so having alexa and having a normal bluetooth speaker for me is same, no value addition. Hoping Amazon will improve its AI features a lot like google or Siri.",4.4

1547,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon
- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).
- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.
- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.
- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.
- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.
- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.
- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.
- Having bought items worth in lacs, I wonder if it was all worth it.",4.4

Google is google knows every answers of your question. Alexa is not that good its good for like tuning light on or off, other than that you'r taking it for knowlegde purpose its not good.

They told me to purchase the same new device since it's a COVID pandemic, so I agreed and bought a new device, and when the device delivered to me after 4 days it was also having the same issue as the previous one, so I called in Amazon help services and registered a complaint, they told me to pair another mobile through Bluetooth so I paired during the phone call to Amazon helpline and played something on it, then it was working perfectly alright, but when I played through the new paired mobile on next day the sound was distorted.

1. Sound Quality Superb,
2. device looks great stylish.
3. Alexa is too good only in those things which are shown in TV ad. Dim the light, play animal sound, so on. But world does not end here.
Cons
1. Integration with other device poor and take lot of time. Software and app working is poor.
2. Voice recognition - Extremely poor especially when volume is above 5. Sometime I have scream, You feel like better Google kar leta kaha Alexa ko bola diya. üòÄ
3. Music - When you say play 90s songs, it starts with same set and sequence of songs. Boring.
4. Every time we have keep for charging.
5. After Wipro smart bulb price deduction, effectively Alexa cost me 1700/-, but won't feel worth. As a speaker only yes it is.

1564,"It definitely has better speakers than Eco Dot Gen2 and Google Home Mini, but sound recognition is very poor compared to Google Home Mini or even previous Eco Dot. Maybe it has something to do with cost cutting and Amazon going with only 4 far field microphones instead of 7.

But due to it's poor recognition, it takes a lot of time, sometimes even minutes and does nothing... Which definitely takes away the experience. Unfortunately I can't return it... But I think Google Home Mini is miles ahead and better with all the new updates to Google Assistant (Sleep assist and stuff).

Update as on 27th April 2019: Software has gone from bad to worst. It plays certain songs again and again, doesn't let you skip. Recognition has also gone from bad to worst, you have to yell for Alexa to understand what you want it to do only for it to tell you it doesn't understand what you said.

1566,"Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.

I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!

Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!

What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.

Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. ""Who is the tallest man?"" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with ""how tall is he?"". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.

Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.

Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get ""updating your device for 10 minutes"".

Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!

Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.

Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like ""turn off the light"", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.

I could go on, but I'll stop here and sulk myself with buyer's remorse.",4.4

1572,"Before buying this product please keep these points in mind:
- You need amazon prime account for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.
- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.
- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.
- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.
- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.
- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.
- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.
- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.
- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.
- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.",4.4

/*Here I'm Uploading video, enjoy*/

Most idiotic device I every bought, never play original songs. Always play some or the other remix or instrumental songs.
I wish I would have bought Google home or some Bluetooth speakers.

After my above review, Echo Dot representative called me, I'm glad for this.
I showed him the issue with song selection but he told me that it is because of library doesn't have songs that I'm selecting and it is better to add gaana.com from alexa app, after following his guidelines, I repeated and recorded issues. Please see the screen shots and listed to audio for Alexa and have fun (Now I realise amazon review doen't support audio but only video).
You can buy this device if you have to have personalised fun in your life. The is not way of attaching Audio files only video so this is again funny, if I wan't to attach some feedback for Alexa why do I need Video :). This is called mismatch in basic requirement.

Note: before one month speaker quality is good and bass is punchy if you play online song by activating Alexa. But after a month with minimal usage, speaker sound is just pathetic, chik chik sound is coming while playing high notes.

- It does not change the WiFi connection. Tried with 2 different phones Android and IOS, but could not change the WiFi connection.
- The choice of music service is very limited. Just Gaana, Saavn and Amazon Music is available. You cannot configure, change, remove or add other music services. And for some reason the device only uses Gaana and Saavn and never uses Amazon Music.
- The Bluetooth is of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices. But you cannot play music from your phone via Bluetooth on Alexa.
- Like the Bluetooth, the 3.5 mm audio jack is also of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices with AUX cable. But you cannot play music from your phone or small mp3 players via AUX cable on Alexa.
- The Alexa voice command is definitely Not that effective or responsive as it is claimed or advertised.
- It cannot help kids in pronunciation of words. If they spell the word to the device and ask for its pronunciation; the device is confused.
- Sound quality is good. But not worth the money.
- Ohh Great! now while I compiled my review, Amazon reduced the price by 500 to Rs. 2999 from earlier Rs. 3499. Now this is really Pathetic.",4.4
1579,"Don't buy it.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Product build quality was nice but the compared Google mini software was not to the mark ,details answering was irrelevant to the question...music support was generally with Amazon music playlist not overall but in Google mini as it was Google product search overall....not satisfied with response and answers....only alarm,time weather it's ok but most of the things were not good on software side....even app gets crashed frequently...I purchased syska smart bulb in prime day as combo....but it is connecting with echo dot...as per the setup process smart skills has to be selected but syska smart skills was not available in echo dot smart skills....then what purpose u d selling combo.......",4.4
1580,"although speaker/sound quality is good at this price but it does not satisfy its actual purpose that is conversation/query. If you are buying this product to answer all general queries/conversation for you/kid then its a waste of money i would suggest to buy google home or wait for next version of google home.
it has limited skills and once you add a skill you have to specifically tell alexa to use that skill to answer your query. Alexa dont have enough smartness to pick best answer out of all enabled skills.
if you ask alexa for joke it will play same jokes in same sequence everytime, that's pathetic.",4.4

1582,"Alexa is so stupid, which you‚Äôll realise once you buy it. There are other brand devices that are more intelligent and more useful. For a silly example, you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúAlexa, switch on Bedroom light‚Äù at once. Instead, you have to first say ‚ÄúAlexa‚Äù, and wait until it responds, and then tell what you want Alexa to do as a separate command. Another example, if you have 2 lights named as ‚ÄúHall light 1‚Äù and ‚ÄúHall light 2‚Äù, and you ask Alexa to switch on ‚ÄúHall light 1‚Äù, most probably Alexa will ask you back ‚ÄúThere are multiple devices named Hall light. Which one do you want to switch on?‚Äù. That means while talking to Alexa, you‚Äôre not allowed to change your mood or tone until the command is complete. Theirs example, if you happen to start asking slowly to Alexa, ‚ÄúAlexa, I want to ask you about...‚Äù, immediate Alexa will reply you ‚ÄúHere is what I found on the web about ‚ÄòI want to ask you about‚Äô‚Äù, without even allowing you to complete your question.",4.4
1583,"Review after 1 week.

It's look like very premium and stylish the sound quality also not bad...

But think twice before spending 4k because with in this price range you will get better speaker than this. As a user right now am feeling that it's is nothing more than a speaker.... Why???

1. it's very difficult to connect with your phone.

2. Need always internet.

3. It can use for setting alarms but no inbuilt battery so you always need to connect with power point.

4. Don't have usb port.

5. Till now am not able to play music from my device memory because it's not paired with Bluetooth bz it's not user-friendly finally I have contact customer care for the same, issue yet to solve but getting proper response from them.

This comment is made by my experience so please go through others experience also...",4.4
1584,"I feel like I should have bought Google device in stead of this one. Alexa simply fails to recognize hindi and Marathi songs when asked to play. Now after one year plus later I realized that I use it only for switching the lights on and off. Other than that it as usual fails to recognize the commands. You cannot play songs from YouTube. Overall I feel like I shouldn't have bought this. I spoke with couple of my friends and they also faced similar challenges.
Update on Feb 16th 2021 : After posting my review I got a call from Amazon and the executive asked to test the device while he was there on the call. As expected it failed to play the songs. Then executive told me that it seems you've got wrong device, it is meant to cater to US region and soon we'll replace your device with the one meant for India region. I was assured that they'll replace my device but no time-line given. I could see the order in my Amazon order list but today, after almost a month the order was cancelled! So it's a big no from my side if you are planning to buy alexa device!",4.4
1585,"first of all the alexa app itself is around 79MB, the app response is dead slow. i got frustrated by the time it took to move from one screen to next screen. above all echo dot 3rd gene doesn't connect any of my wifi networks throwing the error"" registration failed try again later"" while my amzon fire stick works perfectly with all net works. i am very disappointed with the device , actually so excited to use this as i am a die hard fan of amazon but now i had return it.",4.4
1586,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:
1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice
2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.
3 - Dont understand english language properly.
4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.
Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull.",4.4
1587,"Wonder if i had a negative scoreing option. Hopeless product. Did everything possible to sync this with my Samsung Smart TV, all in vain. It just does not get connected and keeps asking you for registration every single time you try doing so. Frustration and disappointment, waste of time and efforts. Should have made the interface easier. For now, it's waste of money for all the Samsung smart TV users. Avoid wasting your money.",4.4
1588,"I agree with some reviewers that the software on this ECHO DOT (3rd Generation) is terrible & frustrating. Most instructions are not understood or wrong actions are taken. Most probably factory seconds or rejects of this echo were dumped in India. While the speakers sound good, the speakers on my phone sound better (without the headphones).
Besides I feel most of these voice regognition devices make you a lazy person & a couch potato..so get up exercise switch on & off the lights yourself, walk move & do your own errands..Meanwhile wait for a better Amazon device.",4.4
1589,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound. Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update. Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.

Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.

Hope they will sent the replacement.",4.4
1590,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.
I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.
My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.
Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller.",4.4
1591,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..

Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.

Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.

I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing..",4.4
1592,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.

Update:
After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling it
out, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money.",4.4
1593,"This is useless device.
0) it is not listening command properly. And we have to speak loudly.
1) It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop. After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming. I am frustrated.
2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.
3) not playing music easily wherever we want.
4) don't waste money if don't have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.
5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.

So please please don't waste your money on it.

Not a smart device it is useless device.",4.4

1599,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.
voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.
Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!

But main issue is it doesn't even play the latest popular songs. Huge disappointment.. I asked to play one song in front of my family, but it started some other music (that was very bad), & then I decided to return it back because I don't want to get insulted.

1603,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .

if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .

My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .

 Lots of request floating in @ What the WATT - Reviews for reviewing this entry level headphones from JBL. We got this headphones from a colleague and thought its time to post a detailed review after a week of constant usage.

We tried plenty of entry level cheap headphones, time and again realizing one thing - ""The bitterness of poor quality remains long after the sweetness of low prices are forgotten""

Summary of review

1. Specifications ‚Äì Mic and 1-button remote
2. Reasons to buy
a. Great fit and multiple right sleeves for that perfect bass response
b. Amazing bass
3. Reasons not to buy
a. Many options available if one can up the budget by 100 Rupees by JBL and other brands

Detailed review

Packaging - The one startling thing you notice when receiving this product from amazon is what lies beneath that packaging of Amazon is a great package of JBL and JBL has not compromised on their values to provide great packaging and great sound. When you compare the same with Mi or boat its pretty evident that there is a significant compromise on the packaging in order to probably provide a good product, but the compromise in other product department is also clear when one starts discovering other aspects of say MI and boat (Rating 5/5)

Design/Comfort ‚Äì When choice is of great sound - its also for great aesthetics, you probably don‚Äôt want to carry an awful product in your ear/body and only enjoy great music, isn‚Äôt it ! JBL does not disappoint in design even at this entry level wired headphone. The wire is long (sometimes feels too long) but after a use of 2-3 days we find it quite manageable. The twin cable is back but JBL has some special engineering design for this good old twin cable ‚Äì ‚ÄúHigh fidelity twin cable‚Äù (rating 3.5/5)

Sound ‚Äì In a nutshell the audio is crisp and loud. This time I believe JBL got the voice of customer and packed a great sound in great price. The beauty of these headphones is you don‚Äôt have to screw those in your ear. One of the sleeve will fit perfectly to an Indian ear and that matters for experiencing the bass properly, a bad fit will certainly be not delivering experience of good bass. The shape of the headphone tube/canal is rightly angled ‚Äì honestly we have not seen such a good design, it‚Äôs a little way from typical JBL design but we welcome that change which reflects in sound positively. Low frequency ‚Äì 5/5, Mid/High Frequency ‚Äì 4.5/5 ‚Äì Voice clarity ‚Äì 4/5. Over all sound is a go from our side and we give these headphones 4.5/5 rating

Durability ‚Äì We ran an exhaustive test on these headphones especially on the electrical joints/abused them and these held on to the connections really long. Infact lifted a 2KG load with the cables to test strength and they did not break at all ‚Äì A specially designed test in our labs

Call quality - Noise cancellation microphone is indeed a treat to the ears while on call and a one button remote is certainly value for money at the price. We give it 5/5 for the microphone and call quality. Remote is of great usage, smart one button remote in same microphone housing - wonderful (Single press - Mute/start music, Double click - Next song)

Overall rating ‚Äì If you are looking for a budget good sounding product and value the brand you get associated with ‚Äì JBL C50HI is for you. We rate these 4/5 and not many entry level headphones get past 3.5 rating from our test lab and reviewers. So go for these headphones (pick any color from 3 available).

Used it for almost 3 months now - Updating rating to 5/5 - Amazing durability",3.9
1615,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop. Absolute worth the buy according to me.",3.9
1616,"Great music.. excellent treble, good base,.. best in this price bracketüòçüòç",3.9
1617,"I recently bought these earphones because I enjoy listening to music at all times and with this one, it's great to do so for its fit primarily.The buds are ideal for all ear size and the canal design makes it stay in ear all times. I did like the fact that it came with 3 sizes for the ear piece, because I can share my earphone with my brother too. And it the large size fits him perfectly well. Another issue that I used to face is with 3.5mm connector is not being compatible with my mobile phone because of the mobile case, but now it is easy and fits perfectly. Compared to the products that are available in this price range, I think this is the best one! The attention to details are credible especially to the connectors and ear buds.",3.9
1618,"There are three things that impressed me the most: Quality of the music, clarity and durability of the product. The cable is thin but looks pretty sturdy. It's got an ideal cable size for comfortable user experience. I give it a 5/5 for the output of highs, mids and lows! The price is genuinely remarkable and maybe safe to say that it is much better than all other cheap Chinese counterparts of similar price range in the market.",3.9
1619,"I bought these earphones a couple of weeks back, during a sale. I picked it up without much research simply beause it's a JBL product but I was truly impressed with what I received. A simple but great package that encased the product. I've been using it ever since & may I say, I have butter fingers and have dropped my phone plenty of times but the cable didn't rip or shred at all due to the sudden drop or anything! Giving 6/5 on the make and durability it offers. Somethings that are worth the mention are its sound quality, light weight and bass. As a student, this fits perfectly in my budget but definitely offers a music experience that is beyond any other product of this range.",3.9
1620,"JBL has always been my favourite right from the first flip, used the speakers before,I have to admit but it's become my most preferred brand for earphones now. The product was not just amazing in its sound output quality but easily better than a boat, skullcandy or a sony. It's simple, tangle free and neat not a whole lot of bells and whistles but performs what it is intended to do really well. After browsing similar products of the same price, it was clear to me that this definitely is the one for me . Strangely enough, I called a few times with the mic and the sound was distinct even when I picked calls while I was in an airport. I have in fact watched plenty of videos with these & pausing it is so much easier with the precise remote button on the earphones. Obviously wasn't expecting such clarity from a product priced at such a low end of things. Fits my budget and exceeds in performance for sure. In fact, I'm so impressed that JBL has introduced a product of this price range too! Another thing that I was really glad to see that its sound quality was not distorted even on laptop.",3.9
1621,This has a perfectly balanced linear sound. Neither too bassy nor too much treble. And the overall quality is good for the price too. I think it sounds almost similar to the Sennheiser CX-180 which is costlier. Also it is light and one of the most comfortable earphones that I've used.,3.9
1622,"A few days ago I decided to buy a earphone within the sum of rupees 500. When I saw the earphones on Amazon it was difficult to me to choose between Boat Bassheads 100 and JBL C50HI. I was confused. So I bought both of them and after using for 2 days I returned one of them.

In the next day after ordering the Boat Bassheads 100 was arrived. I used it. It is nice. Build quality was not too much durable as expected in this type of budget. Also wires are not tangle free. Its 3.5 mm pin is not L-Shaped so it's provide some pain when you plugged it in with the mobile and put the mobile in the pocket. Sound quality is nice but little bit much louder with full sound. Bass is lower than I expected. The main problem is the mic. The mic is little bit far from your lips so when you need to talk you have to hold it with your hand near to your mouth, it is a pain when talking with someone for a long over earphone. This headphone easily fitted in my ear but it becomes uncomfortable when using continuously for over an hour. Earbuds are also uncomfortable while laying on the bed.

After two days of ordering JBL C50HI was delivered to me. Build quality is same with the Boat Bassheads 100. But JBL C50HI has a L-shaped 3.5 mm pin which is comfortable option to plug it in when your phone is in the pocket. Sound quality is more than I expected. Too clear, balanced and pleasant sound. Not too loud just the perfect balance. Bass is superb. The mic of this JBL earphone is placed just beside your lips so you don't need to hold it with your hand while talking with someone over earphone. It is also a perfect fit in my ear and too comfortable for long time usage. I also used it while laying on the bed for more than 3 hours continously it is perfect. In this JBL earphone's earbuds marked with 'L' & 'R' so it is easy to discover that which one will fit in which ear. I just love this one.

Therefore I returned the Boat Bassheads 100. Hence I will suggest you to buy the JBL C50HI if you confused between the former and latter.

But remember Boat has a 1 year warranty and JBL has a 6 months warranty. Your choice.

Edit: The date is 5/11/2020 today and it has been 1.5 years since I bought the JBL earphone. Still working fine. However, the 3.5 mm jack of my mobile might has got some problem since earphones stops working after 5-6 month of daily usage. First time when my earphones were not working I called the JBL customer care because it was under warranty period. As no JBL service centre is located near my location they asked me to send the damaged product to their Gurgaon office. It costed me 35 rupees to send it via Indian Post. Within 3 days I got a new earphone delivered to my address. The same problem happend after 6 month again. Since warranty period was over and I already had taken a replacement I thought I might need to buy a new one. However, I wrote an email to JBL along with the invoices. They saved me again despite exceeding warranty period. That time I wasn't asked to send the product. They told me to cut the wires and mail a picture. I did it and got a new earphone delivered again.

Customer service of JBL is incredibly awesome. üôè",3.9
1623,"I am using this product for more than 11 months till now.

1. Mic is very good quality,sensitive to low sounds (in case you need to whisper :P )
But no button near mic.
2. Easy to listen for long hours.
3. Maintains the genuine bass groove and music quality JBL exhibits.
4. Blue colour is extremely good looking, modern and elegant. In case it is unavailable, wait for 4-5 days maximum, it will be available soon. I got it too in that way. Thanks to Amazon for keeping up to their unique standards.

conclusion: i prefer buying this over the previous JBLs i bought at 800 and above. it gives same music and bass quality, dont worry.",3.9
1624,"The bass response of the earphones is amazing. If the sound is distinctively clear for a song like ""smoke in the water"", imagine how impressed I would have been! The design of it is great especially because it helps in noise isolation when on call and fits perfectly (I got tiny ears :D). And the ear canal fit is amazing. Also one small trick one can do is to twist the buds after you fit in the canal (you can thank me later). I think it's great for the price you pay in comparison to all the other products within this price range + I got it during the sale. It also works great on my laptop. Absolute worth the buy according to me.",3.9
1625,Very good Sound,3.9
1626,"Bought for Rs. 500 during Republic Day offers. This earphone is really sturdy and fits perfectly in your ears.

1627,"Model: JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic (Black) - JBLC50HIBLK
Seller: Appario Retail Private Ltd
Manufactured Date, Place: May 2020
Length: 1.2M
Weight: 13.6 g
Date of Purchase: 20 June 2020
Warranty: 1 Year Manufacturer Warranty

=== Whats different from C200SI? ===
* C50HI is lighter than C200SI (5 grams) - Good
* C50HI has an L-shaped 3.5 mm jack - Good
* C50HI does not have a gold plated 3.5 mm jack - Bad
* Build quality is average compared to C200SI - Bad
* The one button universal remote button design is different. C200SI has a better quality one - Bad
* Quality of wire is better in C200SI - Bad

Pros:
1. Design and Build Quality: Considering the price, design is great and satisfactory build quality too. Except the microphone area, it does look classy.
2. Great comfort and fitting inside the ear - thanks to the good quality plastics which makes it light weight and the soft silicone ear tips.
3. Snug fit and excellent noise isolation inside the air.
4. Superb sound quality. You get almost similar sound experience offered in C200SI which is priced ‚Çπ300 more.
5. The Bass is also good and it is same in the other JBL earphones in this segment.
6. The 3.5mm L-shaped jack is a nice addition in this range.
7. Passive noise cancellation with the built-in mic works as expected.

Cons:
1. Average quality of the plastic built One-Button Universal Remote button. Unlike C100SI/C150SI/C200SI, the click happens to the whole half of the button instead of a round button.
2. Wire quality could have been better, but cannot complain much due to this ultra budget range in which it is offered.
3. Gold plated 3.5 mm jack would have been a good addition, since you get this in models starting from JBL C100SI which is just priced ‚Çπ100 more.
4. In comparison with C200SI, the microphone of C100SI captures a little more noise but also you get a clearer sound along with. C200SI recording feels less noisy but sound is also a bit muffled due to passive noise cancellation.

Note:
The one which i got delivered first time had a defect - one of the earpiece had less volume compared to the other. Replacement got approved and the new one works great as expected, hence no issues.

If you are in a very tight budget, this could be considered, else you can go for JBL C200SI which has the same sound quality but with a better build and a gold plated 3.5 mm jack.
Also please pay extra attention during the usage since there is a high chance to get damaged due to the thin wires.",3.9
1628,"Don't judge by the price of the earphones. The sound quality is great / decent for the price. It may look like cheap plastic, but it does its job good and please do handle with care. I even got impressed with the warranty replacement. Yes, within 1 year one side of my earphones stopped working. I gone to the mailed Harman support and they requested to send the product by Post. I got replacement for the product within the next 15 days itself. Excellent support through email, toll-free calling. I would recommend this if you want an earphone under 500.",3.9
1629,"I recently bought these earphones because I enjoy listening to music at all times and with this one, it's great to do so for its fit primarily. The buds are ideal for all ear sizes and the canal design makes it stay in-ear all times. I did like the fact that it came in 3 sizes for the earpiece,I used to face is with 3.5mm connector is not being compatible with my mobile phone because of the mobile case, but now it is easy and fits perfectly. Compared to the products that are available in this price range, I think this is the best one! The attention to detail is credible, especially to the connectors and earbuds.",3.9
1630,"These in-Ear Headphones are really great. I was confused with MI and this JBL one and i finally decided to buy the JBL one cause JBL is a music centric company so i purchased these and I am really happy with my decision.

Sound Quality:-
Sound QUALITY is really great. Under 500, you are getting an really amazing deal. The clarity of the songs is amazing and feels great.
The BASS is above average, I am not saying it is great but it is not bad also,Like is above average. I am satisfied with the bass.

Noise Cancellation :-
The cancellation is pretty great, like if you are listening the song in full volume then you can barely hear anything that whats happening in your surrounding.

Wear Comfort:-
These really doesn't hurt my ears even after 3-4 hours of continuous wear which is really great.

Overall , you are getting a great device, These are really worth it for the price for which we are getting them. MI earphone cost less than these but these are much better than MI one and you will really not regret your purchase.

Happy Shopping !!!!",3.9
1631,"Sound quality is awesome vis-a-vis Sony MDR earphones that I possess!! Bass is deeper n more pronounced compared to Sony. The ear buds are a little bigger compared to Sony. Also when we plug in the earphones, the small sounds outside like clock ticking, fan sound etc can be heard more clearly when music isn't playing! Once music begins, it's completely different. U can enjoy the sound whether it's a song or a movie...",3.9
1632,"These are amazingly good earphones. The sound quality is really clear and loud and so is the voice quality of the microphone. I use them regularly for my work and entertainment- for online meetings and then for watching movies etc. These are being used with mobile, laptop and iPhone with consistent quality.

All these years I had not given much thought to my earphones, and had been using the ones that came with the phone. But this one is way above those in terms of sound quality.

The fit of the rubber plug that came with it is perfect for my hear and they don't fall out at all. My earlier ones used to pop up of the ears very often.

They do seem a bit prone to damage, but that means you just avoid rough usage.

They are so good that, I got a pair for a friend of mine and he too is very happy with them.",3.9
1633,"This is a great product at this price range. The sound quality and bass is as to be expected from JBL - awesome. It easily fits in my ear and does not feel loose at all. The package comes with 2 sets of ear buds of different sizes (excluding the already fitted one) so you can switch to the most comfortable ones.
The wires are just the perfect length and even though not completely tangle-free it's easy to manage.
I had previously bought the JBL C100 but chose to buy this one because of the L-shaped 3.5mm pin. Now I don't have to worry too much about wear and tear when my phone is in my jeans pocket or while watching something.",3.9
1634,Was absolutely suprised by the quality of these earphones. The sound is clear and top notch. The bass is also very good. Has a pretty good noise cancellation aspect. Pretty unbelievable for the price of the product. I got the red one. It looks really classy too. The build of the product is also very good.,3.9
1635,"Pros : I purchased ""The Cheapest"" JBL Earphones in Jul '20 and they stopped in Aug '21 (Right one only). They weren't used for about 2 months so consider 11 months of ""Rough N Tough"" use ! üòä
Since JBL is basically purchased by Samsung, the Quality is the same as Sam's earphones which they used to give with their phones. So you will get great output (especially for those who are irritated by loud Call Volumes in the new Android phones - After Android 6) I'm not Bass centric at all so I felt these were perfect for me. If you're looking for Bass ONLY, please check out other brands.
Con : On the other hand, 11 months are called ""Very Good"" in my usage but still.. If Sam did the same job they do on their earphones on this one (considering the price), it would have been excellent.
Plus it kinda hurts ears sometimes while sleeping so I suggest Sam's EHS64 are better. They have the same quality audio & it also contains Volume control buttons with mic. It lasts for 1-1.5 yrs so I highly recommend it. üôè",3.9
1636,"#Honest Review
Overall it is a decent earphone.
You get a decent bass and an excellent treble.
The bass is soft its not like hard one.
Its sufficient to use anywhere.
It will not heart your ears.
If you have more budget you can go for Sennheiser cx18 its good than this.
The wire is a sort of tangle free..
The built quality is also good.
If you are tight on budget. Take it closing your eyes.
Take one thing in mind that it gives a decent soft bass it gives the thumping effect but its not that much .

#Update: Got some defect after 4 months use. like the music by itself was getting paused or next. Called Service Centre They Asked to Ship it And The REPLACED ..!
just Loved the JBL Service 10 Stars for service!!!",3.9
1637,Amazing sound. Is good for listening to music and also for voice calls. Didn't try the mic yet. The length of the cable is reasonable. The package was original packing and is imported from Harman US. Got this during Amazon prime days for about For about ‚Çπ400...which is a good Value for money considering that fact that a basic headset like Philips she1405 sells for almost the same price. Even if it is 50 bucks more seems to be a good deal,3.9
1638,"Crispy and clear sound
Vocal are good and clear no muddy sound can be noticed
Noise cancellation not that good but very good for 500rs price range
Pros-->
Light and strong( not for too rough users and not for long hours of listening)
Comfortable
Bass is ediquate
Sound quality is good and clear
Rating--->4.2-4.5
Cons
Angled earbud might be a problem
Tangled very easily
8.6mm drivers don't go too loud
Mic is not that good noise cancellation is there
Mesh is made of fabric so clean earbud by removing them from headphone or dust mesh might be damaged
----‚Äì---------------------------------------------
Good to go for 500 rs",3.9
1639,"First of all ""JBL is best"". Even this product that costs less than ‚Çπ500 is awesome in sound delivery.
Pros:
1. Perfect Crisp Sound
2. Perfect Bass
3. (For all PUBG lovers) Go for this one if you are on a tight budget and you won't regret it.
4. Mic is on the right side and very close to mouth. That's an advantage.
5. 1 year warranty. Do not forget to Register your product on ""Support.jbl.com/in"" and stay tension free for whole year.

Cons:
1. Not for deep Bass lovers.
2. Many say that wire quality is a disappointment but I personally didn't feel that. (Will update review after prolonged usage)

The biggest advantage I found is that ""It's not a Chinese Brand"".

And at last a request "" Please boycott chinese products"". They may seem cheap and good from our perspective but for our country, it is the least we can do.

Thank you.

. Good sound quality, u can hear each n every instrument playing with clear vocals üíØ / üíØ on bass quality at reasonable price üëç
All features mentioned in the product description works well.
U can pause with one click, jump to next song with double click
3 sizes of earplugs (very soft rubber) doesn't hurt the ears like other hard plastic earphones",3.9

Purchase it blindly
Thank you Amazon and JBL. Bought it ‚Çπ499 in lightening deal.",3.9
1642,"At first, I thought I made one of those buys where you get what you pay for. Turns out, the bad sounding quality was because I made a mistake with a setting on my phone.(I turned mono audio on..) After, I turned the setting off... BOOM... I was blown away by the sound quality. I definitely got more than what I paid for... Best in this budget segment...

Bass Quality is awesome, no distortion unless at high volumes (If you want hearing impairment, that is)

Mic is good...

I've bought budget headphones before... This tops all the ones I've bought so far ;)

Go for it... I'd buy it again",3.9
1643,Love the earphones. Good sound quality. It is noise cancelling. Colour as shown in picture (blue). Been using it for 3 months now without any problem. Best pros for me: they are tangle free. And you can't confuse the left and right ear buds :D Timely and damage free delivered by Amazon even during lockdown :),3.9
1644,The earphones are really good considering the sound quality. Good balanced sound as it is a JBL product. Mic quality is also great as I use it for meetings for WFH. The wire quality is little cheap so handle with care but if you use it carefully it will surely last long. So if you are looking for good budget earphone with good sound quality and mic quality buy these without any second thought.,3.9
1645,"I love these earbuds. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the awesome audio quality that comes out of these things. All the sounds are there, the highs, the mids, the bass, all present and all very well defined.

Build quality is excellent. I don‚Äôt suspect these will be falling apart on me any time soon.

I‚Äôm very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend them.",3.9
1646,"Very good product I have even tried infinity ZIP 20 which it for 399 and this is for 449 its worth the 50 rs the sound quality, comfort and looks and better as per me. I recommend buying this product!

1647,"I have been using then for 20 days and the product has impressed me a lot.
it is clear that you want earphones for about ‚Çπ500.
These earphones are by JBL which is a reputed company. They have clearly focused on health of your ears.
1) the earphones are very lightweight and extremely comfortable to wear. You won't feel as if there is something in your ears.
2) the sound quality - perfect for price range. You may get lesser bass etc. But understand that sub standard brands like REALME BUDS, BOAT, MI/XIAOMI etc over do such elements to help them sell better. This effects the overall quality of sound and damages your eardrums in long-run. JBL on the other hand gives very balanced and accurate sound with no EXTRA bass.
3) uses - perfect for calling, video conferencing, attending long online classes/sessions, watching YouTube, Netflix/prime. Mic is also of very good quality.
4) if you really want to get great sound with all that bass and studio quality, spend more - it's only above ‚Çπ1000 that you get the kind of bass ( not EXTRA ) as part of balanced sound to really get immersive experience without damaging your priceless ears.
5) NEVER buy earphones with MAGNETIC CONNECTORS. Speaker itself have some magnet in them and we all know keeping magnets together damages them.
6) As for listening to music, you will have good experience, not THE best but certainly better than any other earphone in this price range.
7) As for downsides - delicate build quality, no tangle free wire etc etc - other reviews cover them well.
8) keep in mind that at ‚Çπ500 you wouldn't get everything as some of the other products claim. So prioritise your requirements.",3.9
1648,"I have brought Sennheiser cx 275s twice as the first one broke after two years and then again one of the ear piece stopped working.
Although i only trust Sennheiser cx 275s, for my office calls as they give me crystal clear voice, but this time i wanted to go with a cheaper option.
So i bought , ""JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic (Blue)"". I tried a lot of sounds with this and this is coming out to be very nice. I am satisfied that too at this price.

No extra bass but.....smooth bass

Jbl always......best in sound quality

Bus biuld quality...is good not best....u have to take care.....
Otherwise super sound and comfortable",3.9
1683,"Sound quality is really awesome and bass is perfect not high and it's provides very good balance with great sound and medium bass and down point of this earphone that build quality is very average but it's perfect as like big brand jbl
I also used like mi basic earphone , boat 100 and
also boat 225 , and I will tell jbl is far better at vocals , bass , treble all are great than these earphone",3.9

1685,"First of all, in the past three years I have owned more than five earphones or so...when it comes to Skullcandy (which I have used three of them) seems quite good when it comes to music quality, each lasted three months since the jack or the wire started to break inside...leading to disfunctioning of the earphones...after consecutive use of three of them I switched to a Philips one, this one lasted two year...which I am glad with the outcome...and this JBL one is going to be my fifth one, as far as I know this one seemed pretty good quality when it comes to sound and bass...but I hope the wire quality could have been better... overall the durability is quite good...but let's see how long can these last...(fyi I never used earphones in a harsh way...just popping 'em into my ears for some music, while studying or during leisure time)",3.9
1686,Powerful bass very strong cable an unique color and design just blindly go for it,3.9
1687,"Build quality is cheap, sound quality is not.

I have used many JBLs, Sennheiser, Boat, Mi, Focal, Audio Technica, Soundmagic to name a few. It's been a while since I saw such flimsy wire on an earphone, so look for something else if build quality has more priority. It's useless talking about it, let's talk about sound.

I am straightaway comparing this with the more expensive C100SI, 150SI, Sennheiser CX180 and Focal Sense 100SI although it's way cheaper. Sound is crystal clear without equalizer. In fact, all JBLs I've used have a really well balanced output. Sure, 9mm drivers on C100SI, the sennheiser and the 8mm driver on the focal produce more bass than the 8.6mm on this one. I changed the ear tips to the larger ones and it did quite the trick. Too much bass actually makes the experience uncomfortable after some time. This one has natural bass, with very good mids and highs.

Comfort: 5/5. It's plastic. It stays in the ear and doesn't feel like much when it's in there. Unlike metal build, plastic is lighter and doesn't fall off + angular tips help a lot. My focal sense slides out at times and non angular design makes them uncomfortable after 30 minutes, no such issues with this one. The ear tips are super soft.

Loudness: Loud enough to cause problems at high volume but not as loud as the focal sense or the sennheiser. Boat basshead is loud but emphasized bass kind of kills the sweetness on those earphones...yes, this is where a balanced output is appreciated on the C50HI. Sound perception is subjective though :)

Durability: I don't think these earphones would last more than a year, none of my JBLs did, even with better wires. Roadside earphones have wires like the ones on this one. No gold plated jack but that doesn't make any difference.

If you can overlook build quality and need a really good sounding earphone within 500rs, this is it. Nothing else beats it in this price range. On everything else below 500rs, sound quality suffers.",3.9
1688,"First off, I would like to thank Amazon for the superfast delivery. I was not expecting them to arrive in two days, but they did.

Now let's jump into the review of JBL C50HI

The overall sound quality is not great, but the bass is punchy. (If you're a bass-head you'll love them)

Talking about the build quality, it's good. It doesn't feel premium, but it doesn't feel cheap as well.

Noice cancellation works well on the street and public places.

Another thing which I love about them is the wire length.

The wire is long and it'll make your life easier while watching movies on devices.

You'll be able to move around without unplugging the headphones.

Overall, a great deal at the price point, you can buy it without thinking much.

But if you have a Miniso store in your city, they have some great head phones under 500.

I bought a pair of Miniso headphones from Miniso for 290/- and they were immense value for money.

The sound quality was close to JBL CH50I.",3.9
1689,First thing that strikes u is the shape of its ear buds. After a bit of hesitation plugged in and did not remove them for 6 hours straight!!!!!! . Have used so many earphones but never have I ever felt so comfortable .No hard plastic things that hurt your ears. They r so soft that u don't even feel them even after hours. They don't drop out. So u don't have to keep on adjusting them. Didn't hear any outside noise so much so that my dad and mom were calling my name & I was blissfully unaware. Didn't even hear the door bell ring !!. Bass is loud considering I am more of a vocal hearing person. Sound output was a bit low even at full volume. I have heard cowon earphone give more output. But decent I guess. Ear buds didn't crack even at full volume. Today was the first day. Let's see how long they last ?. At this price of 499 during lightening deal they are worth it.,3.9
1690,"Because lately whether I buy cheap in-ears from all them seem to have a wide variety of reviews stating bass quality, music volume and all sorts of things that makes you think- Who is looking for these features? I need a headphone and I need one that works. However, my last 4 headphones seem to have a shelf life of 2-3 months. I bought this one 3 months ago, but don't trust this review yet. I'll let you know if it lasts beyond 6 months and that's when you should buy it. Because you are want a headphone, not a malfunctioning piece of wire.",3.9
1691,"Hello Guys, have been using this headphones since past three months and here's my experience.
a) Good music clarity with medium bass and treble output.
b) Noise cancellation is good.
c) The design keeps the headphones inside ears without slipping it out and it's compact enough that we can use it even while wearing helmets without causing pain to ears.
d) Far better than music quality of Boats headphones but can't match the one of sennheiser CX 180.
e) The build quality is very delicate and hence have to take enough care while handling it, especially while storing it for portability on the go.
f) Overall a good pick to try. I have reduced one star for its average build quality.

1692,"Here is how i update my review after a customer service experience....
some how my love for jbl has taken a hit after this purchase. I bought two of these head sets and paid a premium in comparision to other options.. only because its JBL.. and one of the two i bought has simply stopped working.. it started well with clear audio but then the voice on calls started crackling.. and then suddenly it stopped in between a call.. and i kept considering it is something to do with the line...
totally unreliable i would say.. its hardly been 8 months..but i guess never jbl for me now..
And after multiple attempts when i could get through to the customer service number.. they were very courteous.. directed me to the nearest center(which is difficult to locate) but they too.. happily agreed to replace the headset.. i just had to drop off the old one and i would be deliverd the new ones in 15 days.. so although inconvenient.. i am now awaiting my replacement.. that is why you pay for brands.. to fulfill the promise.. trust in JBL... coming back on track i must say...",3.9
1693,"Pretty standard earphones. The wire and speaker housing is okay. Eartips fit fine and the sound output is very average. The highs and mids come out okay but the bass that I was very much looking forward to is just not there at all. I love bass, so this earphones purchase is a disappointment. The overall audio output itself is low as I have to turn up the volume to 90% or full to enjoy the sounds. I guess one can't ask for much considering the cost; at least it works. I only hope it lasts as long.",3.9
1694,"Folks, JBL is the topnotch brand and pls go for this novel one as it is a nice product. The Amazon service is as usual impressive, fast and proper. Thank you.",3.9
1695,"The sound quality is good and built quality is questionable. The wires feel too fragile and are to be handled with great care and caution. And another thing is when i fiddle with the jack it pops out of the socket and I don't know why. I thought maybe the phone case was a problem but even without the case on it pops out. But if i don't fiddle with it too much the grip is strong so my advise for the buyers is if it pops out of the socket don't panic, just don't fiddle with it more, use it in the position it fits well the most. Noise cancellation is quite good and the call button is just for picking calls and u can't use it to stop the music player or lower the volume for my device atleast. But imo these earphones are not meant for rough and tough use. Rather they require more care than required if u want them to last long",3.9
1696,"I am using for office calls in Laptop and mobile calls. Played some music also from mobile.
For bass lovers, please don't buy this.
Sound is otherwise clear and quite balanced.
It's good for laptop or mobile calls.
Music lovers may choose to give this a pass.
The earlier Infinity one was having better bass even though price was lower.",3.9

Thank you JBL for perfectly fooling the customers and to make sure they have no hopes on your brand Darshan Naik , Bengaluru Certified Buyer",3.9
1698,"Reviewing after a month.I used 1 more piston which are the best under 800 rupees while this headphones can beat 1 more in any department except price and comfort.
Comfort- 9.5/10
Build-6.5/10 overall (if wires excluded build would be 9/10 wires are thin :( wouldn't tear easily but accidents can happen anywhere.
Call and mic quality- 9/10(voice is crystal clear and mic is awesome only mic sensitivity is less but for price is good)
Sound quality- 9/10 yeah bass can be a little punchier but man clarity separation is awesome the soundstage is missing sometimes but for this price is decent.Female voice can sometimes be a little painful also depends on recording and bitrate of songs I use 320-256 kbps which is highest for commercial use I didn't tested this on flacs cz I don't feel this price point headphones can churn out the quality of flac codec.My ratings are put considering the price.I think it's the 1 more under 500 rupees of course not same but much better than boats scullcandy and else on this price only",3.9
1699,"A decent headphone at this price and one which includes a mic. The sound quality is decent and the mic is also very good. Don't expect wonders at this price.
My only complaint with this is while using the mic. It gives a strange reverb when the headphone is in the ear. It is not a fault of the headphone itself, but the phones pressing against the ear canal are picking up vibrations from the jaw. I am questioning the utility of the microphone with a in-ear headphone. I don't know if this is just me or others have this problem too. Please comment below if you face this issue, I am very curious to know.
I still feel the headphones themselves are worth the price, so not disappointed in anyway.",3.9
1700,"These are good earphones. Crisp and clear sound. Look nice. Love the colour.
Can't say that the bass is too good though. Also the wires are a little thin, so need to be a bit careful.
Have to mention that the Customer Service is efficient and quick.
Overall, worth buying for everyday use. Got them on sale. So for within Rs.500, a good deal.",3.9
1701,"It has a medium stabilized bass, which I liked it. The build quality is not that good. You need to handle it with care. Other than that the sound output, bass are all fine. It has L shaped connector which also an added benefit. I got it for Rs. 469. It would be better if Jbl had improved the build quality. It never caused any pain while other boat earphones caused pain while using. Good choice except for build quality",3.9
1702,"The product got delivered on time and in perfect condition. I'm writing this review after 15 days of using it. The sound quality is amazing for songs and calls. Noise cancellation is good too. Bass quality is good considering the price. The mike needs to be put near the mouth while on a call because the other person can't hear the voice properly otherwise. The wire is a bit delicate compared to other jbl earphones. But to sum it up, it's a must buy product.",3.9
1703,"I am an ardent fan of JBL products. From T460BT headphones for my workstation, JBL flip4 for my living room, JBL CS760CSI components in my car coupled with JBL GX-A3001 mono amp, to JBL C100SI and now JBL C50HI

my observations so far would be a comparison to jbl c100si which I owned previously

1. I find this to produce a clearer sound as compared to cs100si
2. Much lighter and comfortable than cs100si
3. Slightly lesser bass than cs100si. But nothing that makes a huge difference.
4. wires seem less sturdier than cs100si. i doubt its durability

All in all i would say it is bang for the money you are spending and a great buy for people who are on a shoestring budget",3.9
1704,"Good earphones for standard phone call and listening to music. Noise cancellation in high volume is good enough. The mic is also good and offers trouble free calling experience. Have been using it for last one month, overall very decent product from JBL. I have a similar earphone from sennheiser and both are comparable in terms of sound quality.",3.9
1705,"There's a pretty chance of losing mids.. while highs and bass manage well...
And if you're a redmi phone user, don't even think of this.. it won't sound like JBL... Just like any other normal earphones..

The main Con is you can hear a sound of the wire creasing over any surface..
Not a tangle free wire..

But, after all.. it's a budget JBL wired earphones..",3.9

I used redmi earphones before which had good noise cancellation good, sound quality, comfortable earbuds. But it will get damaged fast just after its 6months warranty. So redmi basic earphones available at 399 rupees is a bad choice.

Jbl c50HI is a perfect choice if looking for earphones worth 500 rupees. It can last long atleast for 1year for sure.",3.9

But overall the richness of the sound i say is 80% of what Sony or Sennheiser can offer.

Rest its very good if ypu are listening alone in a empty dark room...",3.9

Although, you will havr to take extra care handling the wires as these tangle up easily if not taken care. I put them in a case sothey don't tangle up at all and they're working fine and are as new as they were on the first day.
Base- a lil low for high bass lovers

It gets tangled up a lot and it's right earbud stopped working after it got hooked and slight strain was applied on it.
Coming to its pros it has a decent sound quality for that price range. If u are a careful person and don't use things in rough and tough manner this one is a good option for you. Otherwise just skip this product.
If u can enhance your budget a 100/- more i would say u go for the realme buds 2 which is the best earphone in recent times and a great value for money product.",3.9

But i have one problem to speak of that is you need to regularly clean ear buds and change them as frequently as possible. From today the right ear piece started failing some sound is distorting. Frankly I thought this product works for 6 months but it is been almost a year and still using it. At this price range this is the best you can ask for. I suggest you to go for it.,3.9

1727,"So, in a nutshell, JBL has yet again proved that its products are best-in-class. These earphones are the best ones you can buy in this range. Sure, you may have compared it with the boAt BassHeads 100 but trust me, the extra bucks you spend on this are well worth it. The wires are truly tangle free and the mic is placed well near your mouth in the right earpiece's wire which prevents the hassle of constant adjustments. The overall build quality is also solid and light at the same time. Also, the extra eartips you get in the box are of varying sizes so you may attach one according to your ear's shape and size. The aforementioned features are something absent in boAt BassHeads 100 but they become noticeable in the long run. As with all the JBL products, the sound quality is excellent with no compromise in the bass. The mic button is also camouflaged giving it a sleek look. This was my review after 3 months of usage.",3.9

1735,"JBL C50HI in-Ear Headphones with Mic

I bought this product from Amazon and I'm using them for a good period of 3 months. The earphones still work perfectly and sound quality is good. I'm using it with my One plus 5T. Compatible with both Android and iOS.

Value for money-

I bought these earphones for around Rs.550/- , these earphones provide a brilliant JBL experience in this economical price. They are definitely a good deal and ultimate value for money.

Sound Quality/Noise cancellation/Ear-fit -

The earphones have an amazing bass response resonating with great vocals. The bass is a major feature of the earphones. The company has not compromised in its brand name and provides a very satisfying sound quality. Frequency ranges from 20Hz to 20KHz.

Earphones have a superb noise cancellation quality and is apt for travelling and everyday commuting. Such noise cancellation in this price combined with great sound quality are remarkable reasons to buy the product.

The earphones come with three Ear tips of different sizes, the user can choose from these for the perfect fit and as per needed. The rubber quality of the Ear tips is good, suitable and comfortable for long-time use.

Multiuse one-button remote-

It comes with a multiple use one-button use. It is very convenient for calls. One click answering/rejecting calls, pause/play. Two clicks skip/next song. Long press would give you Quick launch access to Google Assistant or Siri.

Reasons to consider other options-

The wire is not tangle-free, and the wire used is twin wire. The user should be careful while using the earphones as the material used is very light and can get damaged.
If one has the possibility of increasing the budget by 100 or 150 Rs. there are many more better options available from JBL.

One point to be minded is that its not sweat proof and there are chances of it being damaged while working out or running or doing any physical activity.
(Discretionary-but you cant really complain on such price point)
Since these earphones are wired, and use a 3.5 mm audio jack, buying these in late 2019 or in 2020 can be a bit backward for some users since more more and phone companies have started ditching audio jack and going all wireless.

To conclude , hands down the best buy under Rs 550/- with great bass response, noise cancellation and perfect fit. I would recommend this product to buyers looking for a good pair of earphones in economical prices.",3.9
1736,It's doing pretty good job with clarity of music. It feels really classy but base is a little bit compromised but overall I'm happy with it's clarity and I didn't expected so much base on this one 'cause I love the music with low base.,3.9

3) less life of the product.
This product can be helpful for people who who want good bass and sound quality for cheaper price.",3.9
1743,"Sound quality is as expected from a brand like JBL but I am afraid that the cable would break. It feels very fragile, as the wires are thin. I suggest you to put a few extra bucks and go for the flat cabled onesüëçüèª.

OVERALL, EXCELLENT PRODUCT!",3.9
1744,"bought 1 month ago , sound quality good, noise cancelation feature is there BUT, now right side speaker is not working üòï, so use your own mind before purchase",3.9
1745,"Been using this for couple of days now. Audio quality on calls is good on both sides. Listening tousic..gives decent output. Comes with warranty of 1 year, I guess that's standard",3.9
1746,"Best earphone in low price with 1 year warranty, beautiful color, noise cancellation is ok not that good, nice sound quality like Sony/Boat.. Go for it without thinking, I feel lucky to have it.. Actual price is Rs449 but some coupon/discount I got in Rs399..
Edited- facing problem after 10 months, inserting earphones Google assistant and music pops on off automatically disrupting ongoing work",3.9
1747,"i have both JBL C100SI and JBL C50HI.

Had bought JBL C50HI after the JBL C100SI.

The JBL C100SI while also great has more low end or bass.

Found JBL C50HI more balanced.

Everything else like sound cancellation, comfort, etc. all the reviews may point you in the direction suitable for your individual needs.",3.9
1748,"Its sounds good , bass is good overall good,light weight earphone with less surrounding disturbance.comes with earbuds 4 pieces.A warranty letter,its long wire compared to boat earphones.Tested the mic too not much as the earphones bt overall ok.",3.9
1749,I have a question on originality of this particular product because you cannot register this red JBL headphones on JBL/ Harman website. But on other hand product is okay that is the reason I m using still now. Sound quality of calls are good but not recommend for music listeners. It will give worst experience. Trible is high and base is only 10%.,3.9
1750,"Typical JBL earphones. Surprisingly good for the price they come in. There's no reason for anyone to go to Boat and similar brands if they get JBL in the same price range.
Bass is definitely not so hard as Boat. But thats because sound clarity is high, not only bass.",3.9
1751,"Sound quality and bass is good in this price range. The build quality is little bit low due to which it need to be handle carefully. It's jack does fit in phones but it doesn't go inside completely. Due to which in some case the audio may cutoff. Different size of earbuds are provided, they block outside sound effectively. The button control provided has one button so it can only be used for Play/Pause, Next and Previous; not to control volume.
It has 1 Yr warranty, so it makes it more reliable than Mi earphones.",3.9
1752,I used it for a year.. it worked fine.. after that 6 months i used it very gently.. many hours of calls for 6 months .. after that its microphone stoped working.. but its speaker quality is awesome,3.9
1753,Cable length is lil bit small.. I found It good. Earbuds are super soft and angled to restrict from coming out of the Ears. Worth buying in this price.I bought it in 499/-.Over all good,3.9
1754,"Angular eartips fit in your ears and feels light and comfortable. You can use this for hours and won't have any problems. Mic in this provide clear sound while calling even in noisy environments. As this earphone fit comfortably in your ears it provides very good noise cancellation and give you clean noiseless sound. Now comes to sound quality. As this comes with 8.6mm drivers sound is very good with clear vocals. Bass in this earphone balanced well. It's not too high nor too low. These are olus points of this earphone.
What i dont like in this earphone that is wire quality. It's thin rubbery wire which can tangled easily.
Second no volume buttons.
If you want a light weight cheap earphone with good balanced sound you can go for this one or if you want better build quality and more bass you can go for realme buds.",3.9
1755,Sounds good but the wires are not looking that durable and you cannot even return the item only replace is available so be careful before you order,3.9
1756,"I am a music freak, i always spend time listening music, i spend atleast 2-4 hrs in my day listening music.

I don't recommend these earphones for a guy like me because, this doest have punchy bass which is the main thing i always wanted in my earphones
So for bass i give ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Comming to point ""for working out"", i also don't recommend this because as you know this pair has very low quality rubber wire which is not tangle free, so this everytime you take out these from your pocket, you'll have to spend 2-3 mins detangling your earphones. Major drawback! ‚òÜ‚òÜ

After getting these pair of earphones in to you ears you have to consider and you have you accept that other than your songs you'll here lot sounds as the wire wont absorb the impact it travels into you ear, what i mean is, thes doesn't have any noise cancellation until or unless you are sitting somewhere and not letting the wire touch any of your body part, it makes sound as it touches something, ‚òÜ‚òÜ",3.9
1757,"I was an apple earphones user and needed something budget friendly. So thought of buying infinity and came here after youtube reviews.

The sound quality is good. But it is not enough. When in high pitches, these don't let the dialog or vocal to dominate. So you would end up increase the volume which is bad for your ears.

Normal sounds it works perfectly. Call quality is good. Noise cancelation is okay for the price.

Bass quality is good but not as others mentioned. You can feel the bass but won't be satisfied if you are bass lover.

Sound quality is good if u can live with first point.
Budget earphone which does its job.

The reason for giving 3 star is, boat 225 sounds better than this. Multiple songs compared and also action sequences. Boat performs better, but it was heavy. JBL is lite but comes with these limitations.

So choose well. It's not bad at all but it's a choice you have to make.",3.9
1758,"You will be lucky to get an original one.
I received a fake. There are a lot of earphones, cheap and expensive, wireless, untangle-able are being made in China and these guys are doing everything to make their local stuff look like its branded. Their print almost matches to the original one, one cannot be doubt about it being local and they have got all the original packing and company stickers and stuff like that.
Well I won't complain a lot because I paid INR 350 and it has good sound quality, bass isn't good and there is no noise cancellation but that's what you get for Rs. 350.",3.9
1759,"I don't know why so many people have amazing review about this product but I have been using sound magic earphones since 2015 and thought of trying this as I have a JBL speakers, the performance of which is great but this earphones disappointed me. As its base and sound quality is just the same as Sound Magic. Nothing WOW. My expectations from JBL was pretty high, which wasn't met. It's a decent earphones given your budget but nothing compared to performance of speakers or the JBL brand per say",3.9
1760,"Okay kind of earphones. Simple sound, nothing extraordinary. Not the kind of plug and play earphones that will give the required bass/punch/wow sound right out of the box, however has the potential to handle extra bass and Treble. Good Equaliser paired with this can give good results, Haven't experimented myself though. My need was calls and sparing casual music/gaming and it's serving the purpose. Doesn't seem very weak/strong. Durability remains to be seen. Ordered from Appario retail on 23rd Jan got on 25th in Mumbai. Update (28th May 2020) : Stopped working one fine day during Corona Lockdown without any apparent reason. Not reliable. Had bought Soundmagic E10C, months before this and is still going strong, though it is 5 times costlier than this.",3.9
1761,"I really enjoyed using these earphones. The sound quality is great and they functioned great for like 6 months.
The earphones were okay, they did their work. But I'm disappointed by the quality of it. The wires were all twisted and kept curling among themselves. It hasn't even been a full year and they've already started malfunctioning. I constantly need to adjust the jack so I can hear from both the earphones. The wire quality is very flimsy, they're bent at weird places and won't get straight. I suppose the twisting and bending is what's causing the rips in the wires. The rubber part that goes in our ears, for me it was quite big and keeps giving me a headache. Wish they had smaller sizes.
I hope the company can work on the durability and the quality of these earphones.",3.9
1762,"Got signature sound quality of JBL as per price of it, well balanced sound, light weight.
Wire quality was not upto the mark. Build quality also poor, jack quality was also poor, feels loosely on continuous uses of 7 days. Please JBL, kindly short out this things, I'm not expecting something very exciting in this price, but at least average quality can expect na !!!

cons: not good bass, length of wire is small

Conclusion: if you are low on budget, then go for it, but if you can go little higher go for Sennheiser CX 180(i had previously, it was awesome)

Songs compared with my current headphone(Motorola Pulse Max): Nucleya - BASS Rani - Aaja feat Avneet Khurmi & Guri Gangsta and Swedish House Mafia ft. John Martin - Don't You Worry Child

Not doubt my current headphone is better(sound quality wise), even after using 2 years.",3.9
1764,"It's been a little more than a month since we started using the JBL Head phones. Fitment into the ear is good and quality of sound is OK but doesn't have a good bass effect and the disappointed part was with the MIC.

Many have complained about an unclear or feeble voice while in a phone call and down the line I have realised that the MIC for this head phones is NOT GOOD.",3.9
1765,"You can see the product is really low priced JBL headphone. So if u r expecting a good quality just because it's a JBL then it's not I'll say. That's the reason why it is cheap.

You can get a decent sound with good noise isolation, but the loudness, bass are compromised, because it has smaller sound drivers. Also earbuds are little harder compared to others.

So, if don't go for it just because it's a JBL. Please prefer slightly upper priced products. The sound quality depends on your budget.",3.9
1766,"Sound is amazing with excellent bass be it music ,gaming or youtube streaming but build quality is not acceptable from such a known brand JBL...Wire is very thin and looks very delicate...buds are also of poor quality...So if ur priority is sound then go for it but if u want better build quality go for another one...",3.9

Before this I've used boat basshead 103, Mi earphone basic , Mi earphone

Sound clarity of jbl is best among all of the above
Build quality is the worst. The wire is extremely fragile you need to handle this earphone with extreme care.
Bass of jbl is the least among the above earphones.
Mic of this one is the best among the above earphones.
Loudness of jbl is also the least among the above earphones.

So it doesn't provide value for money,",3.9

My JBL earphones lasts for 4months only after that one side there is no sound and as of now I am unable to connect to phone calls
Why this kind of Service ?
It will lost the Trust on JBL from Many Peoples
Now I am looking for some other Brand as I lost the Trust on JBL.
JBL should think about that .",3.9
1770,"got it a few days back the sound quality and the passive noise cancellation is pretty good decent base and vocals

the place where the 449 price tag shows is the build quality the wires are super thin the construction is super light plastic and the mic is weirdly rattly (dont get me wrong the mic quality i great but the construction nit so much) the wires are not the best feeling and the connector seems very flimsy (hope it lasts a good 10-11 months) but overall cant complain a lot for the price

if i had to suggest these to someone id rather ask them to spend a bit more and go for the 100SI or go for the boAts

TLDR: good sound decent mic bad build quality

Ok this is part 2 (after using it for a few days)
The sound and Noice isolation is great but the build quality issue strikes again if ur using these and well sitting with the wires hanging (like literally every person would) then the wire constantly rubbing against ur shirt/dress/even beard causes this constant rubbing noise which is much more audible thanks to the hyper thin and kinda cheap feeling wires ruins the entire experience (imo atleast) plus the constant rattling of the mic housing is another constant reminder of the ‚Çπ450 price tag so beware before buying",3.9
1771,"Sound : Vocals is loud and clear, but there is a lack of bass. Its like there is no bass at all... I will prefer this to you only if vocals quality is everything you need and nothing else...
Build : The wire quality is below average. It isn't even tangle free, but every high end earphone under 1000 is same so, can't complain about it. Just is wasn't the right product for me...
But honestly my exepdtations were pretty high for JBL C50HI, and this earphone was far worse than my expectation... But yeah if you want vocals and sound quality then it's pretty good you can go for it... Just don't expect much in the build quality...",3.9
1772,"Date 19/07/2021. It's been half an hour recieving the product and mic's cap fell off. It is just stuck there poorly. Very poor product in this price range. Third quality material is used, cord is exactly like those 50 rs. Earphones. Except the brand name JBL there is nothing special about this earphone. I think its actual worth is around 100. Spending 500 on this earphone is total stupidity. Sound quality is good. Bass is average. Earlier i used to have sony xb 55ap that was the real earphone. It was costly but worth the money. Robust anti tangle cord and deep bass and clear sound.",3.9

Noise cancellation is also very poor.
But it works well when you use it in silent rooms. It will give you JBL effect.

Reserving 2 starts for poor noise cancellation and very low volume of these headphones.",3.9
1774,"I bought this reading such great reviews but I am disappointed. I own boAt BassHeads 225 Special Edition and the bass of that is far better than that of JBL one. I was planning on giving boAt to my dad and use these lol but I am keeping boAt.
You can hear JBL's bass but with BoAt you can feel it. y",3.9

noise cancelling is better and i never thought mic will be damaged so early.
unexpected from jbl.
After five months it damaged totally and searching for a new one.",3.9
1776,"To be honest, the quality of the earphone is cheap sheer cheap I say, because chances are that it might break easily, but sound output is comparatively good not accurate as too much bass, well I am more oriented to flat tones or authentic music listening, so to who reads this might have a contrasting opinion, my personal opinion go for c100si which is 100-150 bucks more but is worth it, infact perfect I will say, better than even Boat 225, again My Opinion, might differ from from you",3.9
1777,This is decent earphones. I am writing this review after using this for about a month. I have compared it with 2 other earphones. Motorola earphones and iPhone 6s old earphones. Although it has decent sound quality not so good bass. It does perform somewhat better than Motorola earphones but It fell short compared to iPhones earphone. I would say that It is not a bad investment if you just want a earphones but I would suggest you to look for some other cheap option as you would likely to find a better one. This JBL product just does not worth 500rs. And If you are sound junkie guy (I am not) that this is just not for you. Let me say that again It does not have bad sound quality but Not like awesome sounds quality as you would expect from JBL. PS. I have checked it for noise cancellation yet. Although It's fitting in my ear is better than my previous earphones.,3.9

Works well with laptop but the pin doesn't insert completely in Samsung mobile and hence sometimes loose connection . Volume max. Doesn't throw up max. Volume in comparison to original Samsung in-ear earphones .",3.9
1779,Good product from the JBL. Best Quality Sound with good bass. Best for Online gamers though music lovers usually buy Neck bands these day easy convenience but this also has Quality Sound. I like it. And I would truly suggest it to others as well. I brought it exclusively for Gaming Purpose and it's doing its work effectively and purposely. Thanks JBL and Thanks to the Dealer for sends Original Product and that too within Appropriate Time period,3.9
1780,"Sound quality is amazing . Noise cancellation is also good . Bass is perfect but not so much high. Built quality is not good . These r not so much durable as cable is thin. No baircoating wire . From jack to mic there is not a single wire two wires stocked together so don't give premium look . Fully plastic made . Also there is no return policy here only u can replace it so . Most imp thing this is made in China product.
Finally summing up
Built quality poor
Only one reason to buy this is sound quality .but not durable .",3.9
1781,"The sound is somewhat okay. Noise cancellation is not good. The sound is also feels a little bit low, that is, it is not loud which is a little bit annoying.
Also, one side stopped working after around 7 months but the good thing is that its warranty period is of 1 year.

Rest it is a JBL product at this price, so definitely can go for it. But if you have a little more budget then don't buy it.",3.9
1782,"First of all very important there is no volume up and down button in this earphone..it only has a play and pause button...It is not the best earphones in this range... You should go for boat earphones.... The sound quality, bass and wire quality are better in boat earphones than these... This looks like a normal earphone...",3.9
1783,Been using this product for more than a year now. My purchase got damaged in less that six months and I returned the product at their service centre and I got a new one without paying any money since it was within the warranty period. It's a budget friendly decent earphones,3.9

need it in a hurry then go for it or else you could save some more cash and go for the better ones...I don't know if I have got a defect product or was it supposed to sound like this coz when I put the volume on high the sound starts to crack...overall it saves my night thou",3.9
1785,"The earphones have good sound quality, noise cancellation and bass quality. No complaints there.
But, I bought them July 20 and by Jan 21, the right earphone stopped working; and by March 21, the microphone stopped working.
I can guarantee I haven't handled these earphones any worse than the ones I had before. But, the degradation was faster.",3.9
1786,Sound quality is average and if you could go and stretch a budget little more you could get nice boat headset good with sounds quality and premium built.. with this headset not worth the money.I thought JBL is a huge brand and in my mind thought they'll manufacture durable with premium built but manufacture cheap plastic material..,3.9
1787,Was good at the beginning. But after 2 months usage there was connectivity issue(aux). Later one side of the earphone stopped working. I need to insert it veryy slowly to connect it to my mobile(same with different mobiles). Didn't expect it to be this way based on its price. I exchanged(claimed warranty) with other one in JBL store (begumpet).,3.9
1788,"Product is not good and not bad. It is ok to listen music. But sound quality is not upto the mark which I expected from brand like JBL. Earphones cannot be used for calling, as noise cancellation is not at all supoorted by this product. Listener at other end is unable to hear a single word, as lot of noise is produced for listeners. Not happy with the product!!! :( Check for some other product if calling through earphones is your habbit.",3.9

Its will be better if company makes improvement in wire material.",3.9
1792,"Sound quality is more than worth for the price you pay but but but it doesn't last for longer than 4-6 months. It's L-shape jack makes cable at the bottom bend while using and with no time it tears at the bottom. Which results in one side gradually both side buds stop working. Worst part you cannot claim warranty, Harman JBL will say it is physical damage and warranty does not hold up.",3.9
1793,"It's an amazing product for sound quality perfect bass, but it's button over the mike, stop working to turn on and off the music within a month, that is the one big problem, and also it gets detached when listening to the music while riding a bicycle.

The Mic is average (typical JBL) but it's nice to have playback controls. However, the part where this earphones disappoints is it's durability. I've used the earphone as a replacement to my previous JBL, and it has not even been 3 months but my left side of the earphone is dead. So yeah, you need to be EXTRA careful using the earphone as the 3.5mm audio plug is not really durable.",3.9

1806,JBL may sound as some fancy brand who graciously provided u with these decently priced earphones. But here's the catch being made entirely out of plastics making the light but that does affect the drivers capability to crank out the amount of sound u expect u still feel the deficiency of the lower range sounds. Noise cancelling Isn't great though but when u turn the volume to max isolation is felt. Somewhere the thin cables makes me insecure regarding the use gives of sense of them breaking too soon. If u are in the he market for some just for casual use headphones these are the ones.,3.9

Bad:

I am right now using my mother's earplugs which is of around 300 bucks and is of Samsung. It's mic is working for fine for last 2 months.",3.9
1824,"Sound quality is awesome but the built-in material not looks so durable.
I bought it 3 times but every time I found that after few days one side gets non functional. & due to warranty policy if little bit rubber part cracked than service center won't accept exchange,so there is a waste of 1 year warranty.
Please prefer Mi earphones if u want in this or less budget which is more durable.",3.9
1825,"An honest review:
I got it today. Actually it is a basic, entry level earphone from JBL. But sound quality isnot pure jbl like, bass supressed, you may fill discomfort after 15-20 min. Build quality is not good. But what are you expect from a entry level earphone under Rs 500? I recommend Mi basic earphone from same price range.",3.9
1826,"Although the voice is clear, but Bass is terrible & very poor sound even at high volume. Effect of Dolby digital is not at all felt. Compared with other earphones & found sound quality of this unit not up to mark. Very flat sound.
Not a worth Buy. Disappointed with JBL. Returning the product.",3.9
1827,"It didn't woek bad except that it stopped working within 6 months. Got exchanged again, BUT that one also stopped working within 1 month. So, I don't know customer service was good at Harman care, but I had to go and get it done ,Amazon has nothing to do with it. And it still stopped working within a month . So disappointed.",3.9
1828,"I brought the product...was ok at the first....but within 1 year it's right side earphone + mic stopped workingüòê. It was during its warranty period, I contacted the service center and got registered my complaint .They asked me to sent the invoice + to cut the damaged side of earphone and sent the pictures for replacement.All the communication was through whatsapp and when I enquire ABT the status of my complaint they jst do resend the same system generated mail to do the same proceduresüòë.

Sorry to say...I'm not satisfied with the service of Harman!yet now they haven't replaced my product even it in its warranty period.",3.9
1829,"As compared to the price, the sound quality is decent. The problem started after about 5 months after using the earphones, the first problem was that, if I plug in the earphones and talk with someone in call then it cut off the calls, idk if its the problem of the jack or my network but it used to happen frequently. And the main problem was the microphone, just a week after the call ending problem started appearing the inbuilt microphone stopped working. Its disappointing as it didn't last for a year atleast, it might be my luck or something. A friend too had the same problem with the same earphones he bought some weeks before me. Thats all.",3.9
1830,"It's good ! Nice sound quality ! But the mic is not that good ! It's been 3 months only and my one side of the earphone is not working and the mic has also stoped working ! Tried calling customer care or their dealers in Jaipur , unfortunately no response ! Was good until was working ! Not worth the money if your looking for talking Perspective. The mic is absolutely rubbish the other party can hear all the other background noises !",3.9
1831,"treble - good
Noise cancelation- ok
Voice clarity - good
Type - specially for jass music
Bass - very bad - simply just 0%

Foot step while playing - clear

I'm a bass lover, we all heard about jbl which means clarity and boom sound.. but my whole thought process was changed after buying this.. I have tried from 2 different phones where at full volume got a slight bass effect, even after changing the equalizer..

Moral - those who are bass lover.. please try with other brands",3.9
1832,"after using more then 10 days i have facing lots of issue
1. when I plug this my volume in automatically going 0 , if i try to increasing the volume again its going to 0 again
2. there is a noise (sounds like radio frequency) its irritating every time
3. some time i was hearing like humming sound on right side speaker.
really I got a worst product.
4. after purchasing this my family member purchased same headset for Rs.450. i got this for Rs499",3.9
1833,"The microphone & sound quality is not as per the expectations.

We wanted to replace this with other product but Amazon didn't allow us, they are forcing the replacement with same product.

We weren't aware of this else would have never bought this from Amazon.

This recent change in return policy is not proper.",3.9
1834,The reviews above are quite right but what I feel about the product is...this earphones work amazing till they work..(mostly 6 months).and after that the right earbud and the mic stops working...Since it's under warranty I got replacement soon...and the same story again...the right earbud and the mic functionality went down gradually. I feel the jbl team should mention the warranty as 6months!!,3.9
1835,I am surprised who gives 4‚≠ê rating to this product. I am damn sure about it who else given 4‚≠ê to this item once try my recommended product in earphones . Y'all definitely love that product. I can buy similar sound quality and similar bass quality product from local market in 200-250INR. Seriously i have too much expectations with this product but it was really disappointing. Headphone/Headset/earphone should have sound quality which makes to do dance moves. Then you can call that product worthy.,3.9
1836,"I love its sound quality. Base is good, clarity is good.
I have been using this for almost a year now and I went to service center for like 3-4 times by now. Even with proper care it stops working in every 2-3 months.",3.9
1837,"All other features are okayish if not good. But I had to return it since after using a couple of times i realized i cannot recieve a call as the mic is terrible. I used MI earphones (basic one) before this for more than one year and never had any issue. I don't know about the higher ranges, but within this price range MI is definitely better than JBL.",3.9
1838,"Pros:
1. Mic is located at perfect spot. So no need to hold it up. Finally somebody used brain while manufacturing earphone.
2. 1 yr warranty
3. Noise cancellation on papers
Cons:
1. Bass is not good. Sound quality is just ok. Much cheaper Oppo and Vivo earphones give better sound quality.
2. I don't think noise cancellation is working perfectly.

Overall it's ok but expected more from JBL esp when you're going for this budget on earphones.
Update:
Mic gave up in 5 months. Speaker quality is ordinary. Not happy about buying this product for this price.",3.9
1839,This was like my 7th or 8th JBL Earphone and also my last because I guarantee it stops working on one side within 5-6 months. Replacing is too much of a hassle and they probably count on it that annoyed customers won't always go through the whole process and just buy a new one.,3.9
1840,"The earphones are good until they last, i took good care of mine still one earphone stopped working within a month and a half of using, also they have service centres in very few cities and if you want a new one (as it is in warranty period) you have to send it on your own expense, which then if they find the fault covered under the warranty issues will send a new one, otherwise not, the earphones are good as the noise cancelling and sound is good but if they don't last even for one month then what is the point of buying.",3.9
1841,"Don't expect anything unusual cause even though JBL is supposed to be one of the best when it comes to music accessories, this pair of earphones kinda disappointed me. The sound quality is more or less mediocre and you'd actually have to pump up your device's bass settings to get that satisfactory experience.",3.9
1842,"left earphones died after 5 months. and the right one started to produce heavy sound for 2 more months before dying.
If this doesnt happen with you atleast be sure that the mic will stop working in about 5-6 months
i have bought this earphones two times and this happened both the times
and this has also happened to my friends who bought it....all good reviews about this have been written before 3-4 months of use..this is why they don't know",3.9
1843,"The sound quality is good enough, but not upto the mark for the name of JBL, thought it would be much better and bought these, but was quite disappointed with it.
The quality of the wire is pathetic, it keeps getting tangled.
I would suggest going for a braided wire like the one that comes with boAt Basshead 162
Zero tangling on those",3.9
1844,"I returned Ptron Boom 3 and purchased this JBL C50 HI and this was big mistake. Go for Ptron Boom 3 Best for gamin and clear vocal. Jbl vocal is muddy
Edit after 3 week use right side not working properly. low sound. don't buy jbl",3.9
1845,"Being a base lover...I really didn't like it.
The sound is really low and no base at all.
The music seems soo dull and lethargic.
I bought boat earphones for 500 Rs and they are way much better!!!
I bought this because JBL is really a brand in itself when it comes to best of sound quality... but i was soo disappointed.
Boat is really doing better in performance.",3.9
1846,I and my friend together purchased JBL C50HI IN MARCH was working very good now after 2 months its Mic suddenly stopped working for both of us. It was really unexpected that product of JBL one of the know brand would suddenly go off so soon. I truely trusted amazon products but now I'm very disappointed. I doubt its not an original product. If this is the matter then henceforth we won't like to purchase at all.,3.9
1847,It worked very well for about 3 months. Was happy with the performance. Suddenly one ear plug stopped working. Not sure how warranty is going to be helpful. Don't waste your money buying this!,3.9
1848,"Not a great sounding ear phone. Music isn't clear. Also, for PubG, the the enemy movements are not clearly audible. Kinda muffled feel. Not sure if it's a defective piece I recieved or the original quality is that bad. No more JBL...",3.9
1849,"This is great stuff to listen to music. But when it comes to microphone, nope. I‚Äôve been looking for earphones that not only have a great music quality and features but also have a great output to. When I speak using these earphone, people can hear everything around me clearly apart from my voice. So this wasn‚Äôt what I was looking for.",3.9
1850,This product doesn't work for 3 month's also money wasted and there is no support from customer care. Also there signature sound is too worst. No bass or nothing. Better go for Ant w56 or boat 225 both are worth the money and have excellent customer service. jbl has worst customer support,3.9
1851,The sound is quality is great. But s total waste of money as it's not durable it's been 10months and my earphones are not working anyone the problem started 1 month ago. I think earphones should have used more good quality wire. Even if the sound quality is nice what no use if it's not working anyone very poor build quality. I atleast expect it to work one year . Poor work done by jbl on this model.,3.9
1852,"Hi. I have purchased the product in the month of May 2019. The product used to work very well but all of a sudden one side of the earphone stopped working. Still there is a warranty period for this product. As the product is under warranty i requested for warranty claim on this. But without any reason they have rejected my claim. It is really an unexpected thing from JBL. Being a huge company they should first care for their customers and should try to find what is problem in their product, instead they are rejecting. Such a worst service.

Previously I used boAT. The service they have provided during Warranty period is really appreciable. I will never go with JBL again. The worst service provider.",3.9
1853,"A big fat no essentially because the unreliability of this product.
In less than a month‚Äôs use one of the sides stopped working, i got it exchanged the same issue took place again.
Bigger no for iphone users as it doesn‚Äôt really fit well in the jack and keeps coming out randomly!
I would complement the exchange though!
The JBL services replaced my first product pretty effortlessly!!",3.9
1854,"The quality of the earphones was very good especially the noise cancellation. But in less than 3 months the right ear piece stopped working. Very dissapointed. I was expecting it to work for at least 6 months given the price and quality but that didn't happen. Really wasn't expecting this from JBL. Would have given it a single star but as I mentioned earlier, on initial usage the sound quality was fantastic.",3.9
1855,"I request all the customers better think once before purchasing this product,i have been purchased this product 10 months before,for the first 4 months these headphones worked fine,after that the right side of the ear phone stopped working,any how have replaced it in nearest JBL store after that again after 6 months of my replacement ,again the right side earphone got damaged.so I'm requesting people who want to buy this product for 6 months use only those can bye it,don't believe that it would be work for a long time.",3.9
1856,"A very cheap product by JBL. Doesn't meet its usual standards. Sound and bass quality is not at par with other earphones in the same price range. Noise cancellation is disappointing too.

Either go for better quality JBL earphones or to stick to this price, explore other brands which give better quality",3.9
1857,"The sound quality is just ok, not JBL like.
The noise cancellation is passive.
About bass quality, the bass is non existent.
The cable quality is also very flimsy and stiff.
The noise from the cable is predominant. even if you just touch or move the cable, it is amplified through the earphone as noise.
Price is too high for the quality offered.",3.9
1858,"Such a big brand name can deliver this kind of poor quality earphones. Unexpected. I was looking for an earphone for under 500 and so brand was not a concern for me. So I thought boat is definitely a great choice. But suddenly I found JBL earphones at such a special price of 449. I went through the specs and they said great bass and great noise cancellation and sound quality. But it is a complete wastage. I felt cheated.
So please do not buy this product. It is waste of money. You can get good quality sound in other brands. I can't believe JBL is doing such fake advertisements.
Go for other options. Don't waste your money on it.",3.9
1859,"I requested for product replacement as soon as I listened to a song using this headphone. The bass quality is not good. Treble is way more than the base which I don't like at all. My old headphone is way better than this one maybe it's because they are of same brand and so they're more compatible with eachother but whatever the case I'm replacing this item to order the previous headphone.

And also if the headphone jack is slid even a little bit a disturbance noise appears which is another issue.",3.9
1860,No doubt..Sound quality is good but Exactly after seven months audio stopped in one side of the earphones. Then I bought another pair of these and again same problem occured after seven or eight months exact.,3.9
1861,"The product is worth the money but for only about 6 months after that the wires start peeling apart and slowly mic stops working,looking for jbl support but this product is not mentioned on jbl support website.
If you can take extra care go for these as they are good sounding earphones,for great price.",3.9
1862,Other cheap brands provide better sound quality in this price range.,3.9
1863,"Never tried it's microphone as i didn't need earlier but after 5 months i tried it, worked good 2-3 times only after that it never worked and also right side of earphone stopped working. noise cancellation is better but bass quality is not good. You can have better alternatives at this price(boat earphones) or spend 200-300 more to get better quality of jbl.",3.9
1864,"It is just an ok product, but there are better product available at cheaper price, i have been using Philips SHE1525 which cost only 279 against 399 (deal price) of this JBL earphone, i would suggest Philips is the best budget earphone",3.9
1865,"UPDATE : It is best in sound no doubt but the material quality SUCKS. The mic and button stopped working within a month and the right ear stopped working today after 2 months, again, brought new one and the same thing happened, the right ear stopped working. The wire also started to wear off. Very dull and low built. I feel very bad now. Please don‚Äôt purchase this product it‚Äôll not last long.
I'm saying this again after buying it twice, don't invest in this product. It'll not last long.",3.9
1866,"Im actually reviewing my earlier submission.. the sound is good while it lasts (relative to the price range). BUT, extremely low tensile wire, very delicate, NOT for rough use.. right ear stopped working after 4 months of use; neither of JBL's helplines, phone and email, are functioning. So ya.. it IS at the end of the day a piece of JBL for under 500 bucks..!",3.9
1867,"Stopped working about a few months back..The wire is of very low quality.. It literally got broken/splitted by itself and one side stopped working.. Had to use tape to stop the wire from breaking..
No bass.. only trebles.. Not expected from jbl
Go for a boat earphone..It has better quality than this one ,I guess..",3.9
1868,This is just an average product.. Sound quality is just ok not the best. Red colour looks so good. Built quality is not so good. At this price this is not so reasonable. After using it for 5 months currently I'm facing some issues with the mic. I had the same issue when I bought this and replaced it within two days of purchase. New onehaving the same issue after using it for 5 months.,3.9
1869,"One ear stopped working after 1 year and 3 months !! This is just sad compared to my earlier similar one from Sony which lasted me a close to 4 years after which I bought this .
Sound quality was not that great to Sony either. Next one I am switching back to Sony or some other brand. Also was slightly let down thinking it would be a quality level of JBL GO",3.9
1870,"I write this review after 55 days the quality of sound good with perfect bass, it produces decent sound for soft music but the build quality of wire are very cheap and left side sound after 55 days stop working if you are looking for better quality so go for other.",3.9
1871,"It's just passed warranty period and suddenly phone doesn't sense it connected anymore, has become useless.
Had good sound quality and worked well for just 1 yr",3.9
1872,"Didn't even last a year. I just used it for my laptop, so didn't use this on daily basis. Still, didn't expect the right ear stopped working after some time. Sound quality is just as poor as build quality. Better to choose boAt at this price range.",3.9
1873,"When I received this product, I was disappointed. It was mainly because when you look at the wires and finish of earbudds, it will give you feeling of duplicate or copy material. Otherwise sound and bass are very good in the product.",3.9
1874,"Not working one ear phone with in six months
I am disappointed
Good reliability expected but did not get it
Want to submit under warranty
Don't recommended this product at all
But you can consider some other products from the same brand",3.9
1875,"Microphone is not good. Need to place it very near to mouth.

Sound is good but Design is not good. They have made a twisted design to fit in ear but the edges of the earphones are causing pain if used for longer period or if pressed in.",3.9
1876,"If you have high expectations of super baas and sound, let's face reality. It's just an average headphones. Not worth of 499/-",3.9
1877,"1) Sound quality is not at all good, good enough for voice calls, online lectures, or watching videos, but not good for music listening or gaming.
2) Built quality is cheap (thin wires, looks delicate)
3) Bass is always good with jbl
4) swapping eartips is a nightmare, not at all recommended doing so. It has to be design flaw.",3.9
1878,The sound quality is nice. But this head phone is not working after 6 months. Some problems will start then. Very bad product. Money lost. I use 2 head phone in 1 year (1 year warranty.so exchange 1 head phone after 6 months & got others one). Both are stop working after some months. Don't buy it.,3.9
1879,Don't buy if you want earphones they only work for a few months I brought these in December 2019 broke in June 2020 the right earphone stopped working and the sound keep cutting out please don't buy 200 rs more and you can get a better deal. The sound quality was ok and due to the design you get noise cancellation but not a lot. It's not worth it don't buy,3.9
1880,"Though when the product is new , it will work good for few months. But after 5-6 months you will start facing problem , first one side sound will disappear ,and slowly both. Not a JBL product type quality.. my experience was bad ... And it was not better than 100rs ear phones we get on streets .
This review is after using it for almost 7 months .",3.9
1881,The sound quality is good but the connector to the phone is too loose. It keeps on unplugging everytime so have to keep minding it. I use a one plus phone so other audio jacks connect well except this one.,3.9
1882,"It was a good product but the joy was short lived. Durability is worst. Not suitable for long term and rough use. Lasted for only 7-8 months that too, due to careful usage. Right ear piece got damaged within 5 months. Not recommended for long term use. Very poor at this price. It was good while it lasted.",3.9
1883,I feel cheated. Stopped working within 3 months. I don't have its warranty card. I threw it . Donno know how to take advantage of one year warranty.,3.9
1884,Product was working fine. It came with 1 year warranty but now one earpiece stopped working. And there is still 2 months remaining in my warranty. Help me amazon,3.9
1885,"I have purchased this earphone in January 2020 and after use of 2-3 months having problems with the earphone jack as it's not able to connect properly with mobile jack and getting disconnect again and again.
Other than that sound quality of the product is super and amazing üëçüèªüëçüèª",3.9
1886,"The silver net came off within 3 days. Also hurts my ear. Something is wrong with the shape of it. Sound is good, noise cancellation is good. Wore is thin. Easily gets tangled. Good for short term usage. Hurts the ear after a while.",3.9
1887,"Not as good as imagined...it makes it's own sound(like khrrr khrrr) while using and starts doing misbehave after keep it plug into headphone jack of phone...I have faced the issue even after replacement.
You can get better product of another brand don't go only on the name of JBL.
And it was not expected from this trusted seller with this much rating.",3.9
1888,"The quality of these headphones is very bad. As can be seen in the image, the earphone plug or the cover got removed. The small plug/ cover on the earphone was not sticked properly to the headphones. This is below expectation. It hasn't been even 6 months still the product is showing defect. Now I have to listen to music without this cover/ plug. I want either a replacement of better headphones or refund.",3.9
1889,I buyed it at 11th September 2020 and today is 31st May 2021.and it's one ear side is not working. It has one year warranty means it's still in it warranty period what should I do .. I want to replace it.,3.9
1890,Like the product awesome bass great sound quality average noise cancellation love it worth buying but after 15 days one side stopped working need a replacement,3.9
1891,"The headphones didn't last 2 months üò™ Although the sound quality was awesome but the product quality was poor..they didn't last even two months, both the pieces stopped working one after the other..I accept that I am a rough user but still expect it to last at least 6 months..
Verdict: don't buy to not get disappointed",3.9
1892,Maine JBL Ear phone kharida par thode dino baad hi Esme sound break hone laga hai or Mike bhi kaam nhi kar raha Bahut problem ho rahi hai. Toh aap meri kya help kar sakte hai.,3.9
1893,It worked fine for 3-4 weeks. Then it started giving problems i.e. It started getting out from the earphone jack on phone which made the song pause and cause irritation for the user. It works fine for laptop. But for mobiles it is not good. Please buy this if you want to use it for a laptop as its sound quality is awesome.,3.9
1894,Bought this one reading all the good reviews but it was so misleading . JBL is known for good sound n bass but this one is complete disappointing. The sound is ordinary n no bass at all . Didn't enjoy music experience at all . Plz don't give false reviews just becoz it's JBL . Most of buying happens reading reviews as there is no product return in electronics ones bought n only exchange with same one which doesn't really help,3.9
1895,"Product was good..JBL mark ..
But worst delivery by Amazon..",3.9
1896,"Very POOR quality. Stopped working in 3 days. Even the sound quality is not great. Very unsatisfactory. And the wires are so fragile and thin. Go for boat instead, sturdy and way better quality.",3.9
1897,"Sound quality is just ok but if cord touches any object, it humms in ear. That is worst enough to irritate you. Secondly, cord is not of quality for durability, no quality in the play/pause button too. No value for money at all as my hp earphone is far better than this. And most important, no return, only exchange, means once your money is gone means gone. Hell of it. Sincerely, stay away from it. High brand name only but cheap ordinary Chinese product, made in china. Better to buy of other good, reputed Chinese brand. Sincerely.",3.9
1898,Not sure whether it is really JBL or not. In the Description mention that deep BASS. We can't hear any BASS in the music.,3.9
1899,"I used this with my OnePlus 6 phone and it's not a quality product. Every now and then one of them stop working and during calls the voice clarity is just okay. I got on exchanged already because the left one wasn't working and with this replaced product it's unpredictable which one would stop working. At times when I'm watching videos left one suddenly stops and during calls at times right one doesn't work.
Looks like JBL stop emphasising on quality.
Though earlier JBL headsets of almost the same price range worked really good for a year and more at times. Which is not the case now. Mine started giving problem in less than a month.",3.9
1900,No doubt its a good headphone sound wise. But it stopped working from one side in just 2 months. They replaced the product from jbl service center but didn't provide me with additional warranty so i have 10 months warranty on a new headphone. So i really doubt that they provide you with new ones. Its going to be usefull as long as your warranty.,3.9
1901,I bought it in October 2019 and it is may 2020 and has not been a year and one side of the earpiece has already stopped working. Probably the quality of the product is cheaper than it's price . I didn't expect this to happen atleast for a year from a product of reputed brand like JBL. Totally Disappointed.,3.9
1902,"Bought this product trusting the JBL brand. But this is a sub standard product from JBL. The sound quality is not up to the mark at all. Noise cancellation... there's no such thing. Bass quality is next to nothing. All in all, a very inferior product.
The lesser priced MI earphones are much better. I would suggest everyone not to go for this.
Also, to top it off, I asked for a return to which Amazon said no, we can only replace. Now Im stuck with this sub standard product.",3.9
1903,"Average sound quality..
Not at all durable...started giving me trouble with the mic just after 2 months
Weird activity with my phone is happening ever since I started using these...
Volume goes up and down rapidly and automatically... üëé",3.9
1904,The item was good at first. But now it's Mike is not working. I can't talk with my headset bacause the other person can't hear anything. But I willl be able to hear what they are saying. A genuine product will get damaged within 2 months. How you could say it's a genuine product. It's the worst experience I have. Already I have purchased 2 other JBL headsets but this is the first time I have faced such an issue. Poor quality..,3.9
1905,"Don't buy it, it's mic stops working after 3 months and the worst part is that when went to the service centre they are asking for the box ... what the hell who keeps the box so long, JBL service is worst don't buy JBL product go for SONY there service is best and service center representative are polite and professional. JBL service center is worst they don't talk in a proper way and gives false information refused to take the product after doing a conference call with cc for more then 20 minutes they accepted to take it and asked for hard copy of the bill... Digital copy will not be accepted... service center where i visited:-
Luckey enterprise , Hajipur 844101",3.9
1906,"this product is an auwful one. the quality of wore is so thin tha it's thinner than sewing thread you can say. you get better quality of wires on the roadside for rs.50. inwonder how come JBL can make such kind of product at all. does the JBL comlany bought by the Chinese? I know max products are made in china but the company owned nbybatleast western countries. they maintain quality tillnthen, oncenits bought by the Chinese then the quality will so cheap and worst.",3.9
1907,"I buy this but 1 speaker is not working i hope this is not original this is copy
I also choose return option but suddenly lock down and now return option is not came I want to return this but how
Very chipper I dislike this
I am sure this is not original",3.9
1908,"I got this for ‚Çπ399 & for this price you are getting a JBL wired earphone. The sound quality is good & the bass quality is also good. Only the wire quality is a little delicate, you have to be really careful while using it. Overall a really VFM product üëç

Update - After using 4 months, the mic stopped working...
Update - After 6 months the right side speaker stopped working...

Final words:- Don't go for this product.. add 200/300 ‚Çπ more & buy a good earphone..",3.9
1909,"I went ahead and bought this product only because of the brand recognition ""JBL"" ,but I feel cheated and disappointed. The Mic was malfunctioning from day 1 itself,and the right earbud stopped working just in 9 days. The build quality is inferior/sub standard and very cheap, wire is very thin, short and not at all durable for even normal usage. I have to go to the service center now to ask for a replacement just within ten days. Utterly disappointed and I don't recommend this product to anyone.",3.9
1910,Sound and bass is so good that you will purchase the product by its quality but the life of product is so bad that you need to replace it in minimum 5 months. I have replaced it after every 5 month and now again my headset is not working since lockdown and now i am not willing to go at service center. I purchased it due to quality but suffered from replacing it again and again.,3.9
1911,Not a good product... it mike stopped working within 3 months..... the worst part is its pathetic customer care. This product comes with a 1 year replacement warranty. Harman Jbl customer care is worst. They keep on rejecting your request and keeps on asking to send delivery address but never approve. N finally customer gets tired of calling n sending them the details. Its indeed a worst n a terrible experience. Its been a month now n they are not sending me a replacement product and keep asking for address and disapproving. Finally tired and gave up. Worst experience ever......dont but the product looking at its warranty clause.... its pathetic....,3.9
1912,"It didnt even last 1 month. Overall impression of the product on Day-1 was very it is a very average product.

In less than one month it started non-functioning. Initially left side of the earphone stop working, gradually the mic also stopped working. Now I can only listen through one side of the earphone and can‚Äôt use it for calling purpose as person opposite cant hear me at all.

It is due to great respect & trust on the brand I ordered JBL headphone. However, I am utterly disappointed with the performance. During such trying time it is difficult to run to service centers over and over again.

Though it mentiones 1 year warranty but it is unlikely that one will find service centers (which is very difficult to find) and travel to the service center. Moreover chat service in JBL support link is below average and they dont have any calling service. It took me more than an hour to reguster my complaint. Lets see how promot are they in respoding to complaints.",3.9
1913,"After about 1-1/2 month of use the universal button stopped functioning. Initially assuming it could be due to moisture or dust, I tried tried drying/cleaning etc....but on trying out multiple options (as per JBL's portal/community suggestions) but I found that button/Mic is NOT working at all so I complained to JBL, initially they did not respond but on follow-up they responded with same suggestions that were on their portal, when clarified that all the attempts have been made, they insisted on visit to their service center when there's known challenge of travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, besides added cost/time for their service center located more than 30 Kms away. Their response[s] to each follow-up have been same [as if it's a bot responding to text] without any change. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND SUCH A POOR QUALITY AND PATHETIC SERVICE to anyone.",3.9
1914,"I am writing this review not for the physical features of the product, but for the service of the Hanah company. The overall product is good. But it won't last a year and if you claim for repairment of the product under the warranty period, they'll advise to destroy the defective earphone, saying that they'll send a new product. But when you cut the earphone and send the proof to them, they simply don't reply and don't send any new product. This happened not only with me, but also saveral buyer I know. So be aware of this.",3.9
1915,"While the noise cancellation, sound quality and base are okay; the headset does not provide any shielding against radio frequencies. So, we keep on getting the same blipping noise from this headset that we get from a speaker kept near a phone.

Since it is in ear piece, it is really annoying. Getting this from JBL was not expected. I threw the casing and cover before trying this headset - so, I can not return it as well.",3.9
1916,I got his headset in Feb 2019 and at the time of writing this review it has stopped working properly. This headset randomly activates assistant and sometimes it chnages the song to the next one. Don't buy this.,3.9
1917,"The product is good but the service that came along was terrible. When I ordered it there was JBL 75 years anniversary offer with this product and I was assured of a 3 month prime membership, swiggy food coupon worth 100R and a JBL coupon. But after buying it in May, I encountered lots of problem regarding claiming this offer. The Amazon customer care told me to speak with JBL and they told me to do the opposite. This happened for like a month and half. After that JBL told me that the problem will be solved in a couple of days but it still went on and I never got any code to claim or anything from their side. At last when I called JBL they told me that their policy regarding that offer has changed and it's applicable only on products above 1000Rs. I was scammed by both Amazon and JBL. I thought to do a complaint but then I remembered I didn't have any valid proof like call recording with the customer service. Next time onwards I'm recording every thing when I call them.",3.9
1918,"The product I recieved was in a very bad condition the product seemed to be wet at the time of delivery the product was not in a state to open it was been damage there was not seal , the delevery boy insisted to open and check the product weather it was my product or no ,

I have returned and replaced the product two time already and have to replace it again üò°
It's April now so I have replaced this item almost 2 time now to receive a item with the same defect
I have always been a fan of of jbl products but this particular model is just s#it
Update got a replacement and the same for the replaced product
So I have to replace this piece of crap for the 4 th time within 7 months",3.9
1920,"I would've given 5 star if in the product description they didn't say ""JBL True Bass"" and all the marketing drama. There is absolutely no bass. But they are very good otherwise. I bought it for my mom for its light weight and non bassy sound. These are very very light at 13g and doesn't hurt the ear at all. Sound quality is good but without bass. For YouTube videos and occasional use, it works. Mic quality is good.",3.9
1921,"Well I thought it would be wonderful to have headphones from JBL as the master the suond but I was utterly wrong it is one of the most pethetic item I ever purchased, local thele waala Rs.50 headphone produces far better bass but this one does not.... I won't recommand buying it on top of that they are willing to replace but no refund.",3.9
1922,Intially the product performance was quite satisfactory. But later one of its ear piece stopped working. There is no damage for the wires or anything around it. It has been used very less and surely not by wear and tear. I am using other products under this brand and is quite happy but this depressed me. Never expected from a product of JBL. I need a Replacement for this product as soon as possible.,3.9
1923,I purchased after seeing JBL brand...product packing was super....all logo of JBL...but what's the point when the product look is only good..but product third class poor quality...guys plz save money...dont go for it...buy from the shop local on 100 rupees which will atleast work for 6 months..better then 15 days working g,3.9
1924,"Am a Bass lover, music without Bass in to be considered as old schools! But brands like JBL shouldn't come into budget markets that brings down their standards. This is a poor product from JBL and never go after this product. If you want to experience a JBL product you have to spend an additional 3k to taste their expertise. Better go with Boat or Real me with the same budget you got a Bang for bucks! To keep it short this is like buying a BMW key without the Car! I returned the Keysüòú",3.9
1925,"So so quality- not bad, not good.
All qualities are average, like a non branded earbuds . A minor difference about 19-20 can be realised among . Cable quality is not good , it is 2 parallel cables, always twisted after used of almost 2 weeks. It means cable made with a low grade pvc. There is no clamp or hook attached with cable to hold it firmly.
In photography, the blue one is jbl and d white is local non branded.

Very bad product , no sound in right side bud. It's being faulty within 8 months. Do not buy jbl.
Today 26 May 2021-
To buy this product I feel harassed all the time when I was using it.

1927,"Update: got a replacement and was working fine. However, exactly after warranty period one of the ears stopped working. Quality wise not up to the mark.

It's an ok-ish product. The one that I got (for ‚Çπ399) seems to have some defect. Songs get skipped automatically, voice assistant gets activated without doing anything. I believe some issue with the button.",3.9
1928,"I received defective one, it was normal but as you increase volume it start making poping sounds.

1930,I purchased this before 6months and i had to return this product twice and get a new piece in warranty as the right earphone stopped working and few months later the mic also stops working. this happened twice already during the warranty period. better to buy any cheap roadside earphones than buying these as these last only for 3months max.,3.9
1931,"Its a good ear phones however after a month head phone mouth piece not working i spoke with Amazon rep told submit the head phones near by authorities dealer sri sai communications in hardy complex, i submitted on 16 January 2020, authorised dealer was useless no proper response they will not answer the call, then i called to JBL customer care spoke with Venkat Supervior told he spoke with store manager, dealer manager gave false promises that within 1 week i will receive my head phones, after 1 week i called JBL CUSTOMER SERVICE spoke with another supervisor after 45 to 50 days i got a different head phone which i didn't liked if i refuse to take that head phones again i have to wait 40 to 50 days for replacement, so i have taken that head phones and using blindly, over all experiences was HELL",3.9
1932,"The earphones are too expensive for what you get.
There aren't additional eartips.
The wires are very thin and tangle very easily. Wires are also split straight from the 3.5mm jack and are just glued together.

Sound is decent, but at this price range all earphones have decent sound. So don't chase sound quality.

Feels like a cheap product and not from JBL.
Please skip this product.",3.9

I would not recommend this particular earphone.",3.9

To my surprise, this product turned out to be a piece of Crap!!! utter crap!!!!

The BUILT QUALITY IS SUCH PATHETIC that the wire of the earphones gets tangled and DEVELOPS A CRACK in the wire. To add to the misery, this product stopped working in less than 10 months of purchase.
when claimed warranty, JBL says that any physical damage is not covered under warranty.

When contacted the JBL helpline, all they say is ""sorry for the inconvenience caused""
The ''sorry'' card played by JBL will not compensate for the loss caused to the customer.
Hence, Please DO NOT BUY any products from JBL.

Instead, TRY brands like boAT, Sony etc.
They got much better built quality than this crappy JBL.",3.9

It was working well but one fine day there was a loose connection for the cable and
Stopped working after 1 month.

I didn't feel the sound quality good or was it loud even on full volume on.

Overall : not satisfied with my purchase.",3.9
1940,Doesn't sound like JBL at all. Sound quality very bad. No bass at all. Outer quality also very bad. Feels like local earphone which people sell in the railway station or roadside for ‚Çπ30/-.

1944,"A really disappointing purchase. One of the earplugs is not working! Moreover, the tag is dirty and old, therefore I can only conclude that the product has been used before.

One of the worst .... Service center.",3.9
1946,"Less than a year since I purchased it, it started acting up. As soon as a call comes, the google assistant will switch on or the call will disconnect by itself when you connect the earphone.

This happens to be the product issue bcos the product has 1 year warranty which expires next year.

The quality on begining isn't as same when we compare after use.i couldnt replace it any further.it was my second product after replacement.still the same issue of improper connectivity and jizzy sound.
And above all of the reasons : we cant rely on it while calling someone via this earphone.the mic is very poor.worst experience with jbl.though i wasnt able to replace it any further ,i still kept is as packed.
PLEASE GO WITH OTHER JBL PRODUCT BUT NOT WITH THIS MODEL.ITS WORST AND IF U DONT VALUE YOUR MONEY THEN WASTE IT..",3.9
1952,"1. Purchased one - rather blindly looking at the reviews + the reliability that comes with the name.
Was really disappointed to see - the earphones mic stopped working within less than a month.

2. Before the earphones went bad - I‚Äôd ordered another one for my sister- believing it‚Äôs a nice product. And guess what? The other one stopped working too! The left side of the earphones just stopped playing music.

There‚Äôs something seriously wrong - if you can‚Äôt provide a product with quality that stands up to the brand name. Just DONT Sell. Or raise your price.

It‚Äôll now be a pain in the a to get them replaced. I hope it‚Äôs done quickly",3.9
1953,"One of the worst earphones in the market, quality is bad. After about 4 months of use, this has started behaving badly and unexpectedly. Really not worth the money. I am not sure they are the real JBLs. BOAT is a better make for a low price. Look before you leap.
This is pure cheating! Beware of these people!",3.9
1954,It worked fine for few months but after that the volume of the phone to which the headphones were attached started increasing and decreasing automatically. The video automatically used to play and pause. The apps automatically opened and closed. I think its all because of the 1 touch universal remote which is not compatible with many phones. I use Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1.,3.9

Now I can't even return this non working product and wasted money",3.9
1957,I am sure it is not a real JBL. In the Description mention that deep BASS. We can't hear any BASS in the music. Very POOR quality. Stopped working in 3 days. Even the sound quality is not great. Very unsatisfactory. And the wires are so fragile and thin. Go for other brands instead.,3.9
1958,I have used this product for hardly a month and now only one earplug works which is disappointing. In a few days time the headset is fully dead. The sad part is even though it says one year warranty there is no proper service centre for this @trivandrum. I‚Äôm not able to locate this place and they won‚Äôt answer the calls we make.

I tried contacting the JBL customer care through toll free , I raised complaint on portal and also emailed them with 3 reminders without any response.

Highly disappointed and would NOT recommend this to anybody.",3.9
1964,"It's made my life easier.
Writing this review after 1 month of use.
1. Can wash everything from socks to curtains and sofa covers,rugs, bedsheets and everything comes out clean and dry.
2. Just put the clothes, fill liquid detergent and I complete all my housework while clothes are getting washed automatically.
3. There is soaking option also so in 75 minutes cycle all my clothes are soaked, washed, rinsed and dried. Makes life comfortable.
4. Even if electricity goes it doesn't matter as it starts from the same point when it was stopped.
5. Sometimes it happens I started the machineand come to my room and found a pair of socks that I forget to put..no problem..I just switch off the machine, open the lid and and put the socks inside and switch on the main switch again. No reprogramming required.
6. Only 1 thing sometimes the lint of other clothes gets deposited on woollens or jackets. So it's better to wash woollen clothes separately from daily wear. But it can be dusted off easily with a cloth brush after drying.
7. And most important the machine self cleans itself.
8. I purchased a long drain pipe separately as the drain pipe was too small. Now drain water is spilled out directly near the drain hole and my bathroom remains dry and clean.
9. Saves time, your hands and feet are soft as you don't need to put them in soap and water everyday for washing clothes. In one month my feet have become soft and pink.",4.4

OVERALL EXPERIENCE -

I Bought especially due to best seller product. Having perfect to my 4 member family. Weight is lightwright. Looking premium as compare to any others.

Ad per my opinion The brand trust is most important in such high range valuble things because whenever you required service it should be NEAR TO YOUR LOCATION as well as the parts availability and the service should be really important factor.
As per my view SAMSUNG have the capability to make trust from a long years with there service as compare to others as well as personally I really love there services as they treat with there customers.",4.4
1966,"This top-loading washing machine is really easy to use. I bought it for my mother, who is used to a semi-automatic WM. I found that she is able to adapt and use it with ease. It takes a little more water compared to front-loading machines, but almost the same or maybe less than semi-automatic WM.
The overall washing perfomance is great.
I ordered the machine at 4PM, it got delivered the next morning at 8AM, at Durgapur (WB), I booked the free installation by calling the Samsung customer care. The engineer visited at 11AM, same day, and the machine was ready to use soon. I purchased a stand to keep the machine. I am really happy with the extremely prompt service of Amazon and Samsung customer support.

1967,We got this in the month of May '2021 initially I was skeptical about it but it is really nice the monsoon option is a.feature which really helps the clothes get almost dried which very helpful they had this facility extendedable pipe for atleast 10cm which was great as we could deattach and reattach whenevr it is necessary. Service installation as well is good he offered us a cover and a really good stand it was little costly but the stand was worth which is movable and adjustable. He gave the machine cleaner as well to clean the entire machine and keep it in good condition. When u compare with front load this doesn't give my much sound which is really good. Over Al it was an affordable and more options washing machine.,4.4
1968,Good washing machine first time ordered a big appliance from Amazon . I am extremely satisfied with the delivery service and Samsung service engineers called and arranged for a demo the very same day .

1970,"I am very happy and satisfied with this purchase. We got it at a very good deal.
My previous washing machine was Haier.
This is the first time I'm using Samsung.

Design and colour is very good. The washing machine is very compact for a small family like ours.
The features of the machine is exactly what we're looking for.
We had problems with filters with our previous machine. Now, the filter here looks sturdy and well made. The diamond drum is made well. Hopefully the clothes will be washed properly without damages, in the future üòÖ

We can give a better review after using the washing machine for a few months.",4.4
1971,"Very easy to use and silent operation. You can wash, rinse and spin clothes separately as well. Detects the water level automatically. Has quickwash and energy saving cycle options as well. You can use these options when washing less soiled clothes. Looks great and the installation was done on very next day of the delivery. I bought it for Rs 12,600 with SBI card offer, during Republic Day Sale.",4.4
1972,"Washing is such a mundane task for me. This washing machine makes it easy. Just a few clicks load your laundry and detergent and conditioner and forget about it. Come back after the exact time. Your laundry will be soaked, rinsed and spin. This is exactly what I needed since I was looking for a top load basic machine. It does exactly what they say. I installed it in my apartment by myself and it's an easy process.",4.4
1973,"This model of Samsung washing machine is a great product for families up to 4-6 people. It's very affordable, and the size is compact. The options are just enough for us to handle anything and everything we can imagine. The monsoon function is exceptionally useful and dried clothes very well. Clothes DO NOT entangle which is great too. Just start and forget. We are yet to use the delay feature, but it's a great option too. Delicate mode makes life easier.

Overall , it's a great product, backed by Samsung's service. We are very happy with it.",4.4
1974,"This is a tried and tested washing machine that we have been using. Had the same machine at my home town as well.
For people who are looking for a washing machine and are confused, this is the best option that you can go for. The pricing is very economical and the functionioning is very good.
Quiet easy to use and operate.
Noise levels are very minimal and is a Value for money product.
This is 6.5kgs and is sufficient for a family of 3-4 people.
The demo guy came on time the next day.
Would definitely recommend this product to everyone whoz confused on which washing machine to buy.
Energy consumption: 5/5
Looks: 5/5
Functions: 5/5
Noise level: 4/5
Washing: 5/5",4.4
1975,"Value for money.
Used it for almost 2.5 months now.
It had been a good experience.
This has all those hidden features which you come across a 15k below machine.
Only thing is they have forgotten to highlight some features. ;)
Ordered for a normal machine and got a 3* rated machine. Thanks amazon and Samsung.

Main pros are -

No much difference in E Bill.
Noise levels are low
Installation process was hassle free. ( we live in Hyderabad though.)
Really helpful for a working and non working class people.
Overall, decent product at decent price.
Expect less and you get moreüéâ",4.4
1976,"I have alreday used Whirpool Top Load Machine since 2018.
But this machine is truly amazing.

Wash clothes like pro with no hassle.

Programs are very easy to use and system is cool.

Most importantly it's used very less water and electricity.

Just loved this.

I recommend to my sister and she bought and after using 7 days she also loved this.

Thank you Samsung and Amazon bring this machine with a worthy deal.",4.4
1977,"I brought the machine about 10 months ago and I have faced couple of issues but Samsung Care executives came home and checked the machine, apparently it was low pressure of water that was creating havoc.
I sorted that out with a mini pump that provides a better flow of water to the machine.
Quite satisfied with the response from Samsung. Would recommend to those on tight budget.
Only cn",4.4
1978,"This is the 3rd washing machine of this brand (Samsung) and model (WA65A4002VS/TL) that I have purchased. The machine is noiseless, easy-to-use and one of the bestsellers on all major online marketplaces. Samsung installation service is excellent, but please make sure the tap you're planning to connect to this machine has sufficient water pressure (and fix it beforehand, if not). It has 5 wash modes, but the 'Quick Wash' and 'Soak + Normal' modes are the ones you're most likely to use for day-to-day laundry. Highly recommended.",4.4
1979,"Hello ,

I have been using this washing machine for around 3 months now.

Pros:

1. Clothes get cleaned satisfactorily
2. Almost noiseless
3. Very efficient and fast
4. Looks cute
5. All the essential functions are there including the powerful Monsoon dry function.

Cons:
1. None so far

If you are looking for a budget washing machine for 2-3 people, go blindly for it. There aren't many awesome machines at this range.

Until next time

1980,"Like :
Easy to Use: just put the cloth inside the machine and press sart button.
Less Water Consumption : in-built feature of loading water automatically as per the clothes, the washing machine decides an adequate amount of water required for the wash.
Size : compair to semi automatic machine it's take less space.
Effective Cleaning : not required Scrub the clothes before putting into the washing machine.

Dislike :
Alert / buzzer : buzzer sound is low
Electricity Consumption : it take more electricity compare to semi automatic machine, a single run take 45 min.",4.4
1981,We exchanged a older LG to this one. Works well. No complaints after 2 weeks. Simple to operate so older folks can use - not too many buttons. Got it for a great deal from amazon with exchange. Unbelievable value for money. Delivery from Amazon was without hassle and damage free.,4.4

1984,"I'm going to keep this review short and simple. So we bought this washing machine around 1 month back and have had no problems so far, this thing takes workload like a beast and gets the job done in a jiffy. Kudos to amazon and the seller for delivering this in perfect condition!",4.4
1985,The washing machine is super helpful. It's a great value for money at this price. Only downside is it fills water to its brim for both washing and rinsing irrespective if the clothes are less or more. So water is wasted . Apart from that rest everything is awesome,4.4
1986,Previously i hv semi automatic washing machine it was so time consuming and very hard for use because all the time one need be there to wash and rinse and spin the clothes...but now it's very easy for me just to put dirty clothes and after few minutes your clothes r clean no need stay nad watch all the time this machine have very easy use functions as well as energy saving and perfect working woman...,4.4
1987,"The product was delivered on time and installation was done within 48hrs. There was a minor fault during installation so the machine broke down, but amazon and samsung both were helpful regarding repairing the machine. The machine is running smoothly now. It is not at all noisy, the controls are fully automatic so very easy to use. One thing i noticed is that it uses less water compared to my old machine (whirlpool top load fully automatic 6.2kg), so this machine saves water too. I would suggest this machine considering its low price and high quality and service.",4.4
1988,Best Washinmachine in the market. My all family members use the same brand from long time. Even one of mechanic suggested to buy this or LG for longer life. I got installed with my known mechanic as he gave got rest Washinmachine accessories fitted by himself.,4.4
1989,"It's a very worthful product when compared with other companies. It's very easy to use. Brand installation is successfully completed and their demo can be understood in a easy way.
When coming to washing machine it is very useful product and low noise emitting.",4.4
1990,"Best you can buy.. I literally love using it. I would recommend to all that yes you all can go ahead & bou this washing machine.. It's just bestest you can ever get. I really loved it. You can wash blankets too upto 6.5 kg as the machine is of 6.5 right & if machine is 8kg you can put clothes till 8kg ..So as of now this machine is of 6.5 kg so you can wash upto 6.5 kg blanket ..n if u are washing 6.5 kg blanket then you should wash one at a time
... You can even wash net clothes/sarees in delicate wash .",4.4
1991,"Like the samsung service guy, polite and helpful.
Works nicely, have another similar model from last 3 years.
Top load samsung washing machines are very much reliable in long run no doubt.",4.4
1992,"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage and I must say it works very efficiently, clothes are very well washed without any external efforts however it takes more time to complete cycles but overall its perfect washing machine for small families with working women also its noise cancellation feature is worth mentioning ,a reason for adding more stars to it .üòÉüòÉüòÉ",4.4
1993,"Nice product. Don't install it yourself, not even open the cardboard box. You will spoil the warranty if you do that. Installation engineer reached home after one day. He was polite and checked the working condition of the machine as it was already installed by myself.",4.4
1994,"Good for homes where seperate water tap available but i am living in rent so everytime i need to connect water tap to water hose to fill the water and if any time water is less machine will stop and stuck at same time so you need to refill the remaining water and
Power cut is also very big problem in my area every time if power is cut machine will start from beggining and it is very annoying sometime it will take whole day to wash some cloth",4.4
1995,Its good but only problem is when it starts to spins then it make some initial noise of banging to the body but once it pick of the speed then it gets normal. Value for money and very good if you buying washing machine for first time. If its your second time purchase i would suggest to go with front load.,4.4
1996,"I have a Samsung Front Load and have been very happy with it. This one i ordered for my farm house. Its so good, actually better than the FL machine. I liked it so far.",4.4
1997,Using for 3 months now..perfect product. 5/5 in all categories.,4.4
1998,Excellent machine. Very easy to use. No wobbling etc. as reported by others probably because the machine is placed on tiled floor in my bathroom and is perfectly balanced. Very good spin drying. I am also using LG front loading direct drive in another residence of mine and this machine performs equally well. Pl go for it.,4.4
1999,nice product I have purchased this machine in 6.5 variant but it looks very small the drum is very small doesn't look 6.5 my old LG machine was 6 kg and that was bigger than this,4.4
2000,Loved the product after using it . Very easy to use and does not damage clothes. Installation process was also smooth. I am mainly washing heavy clothes like curtains and bedsheets and comes out almost dry . Soak option helps to get rid of tough stains . Very happy with the purchase :),4.4
2001,I ordered this washing machine after extensive research and found this was the best weight to cost ratio appliance. You will need to have a water connection within a 1 meter reach and an elevated dry space to keep it. It is pretty lightweight too so placing it on the first floor also wasn't a hassle. Overall a good buy and highly recommended.,4.4
2002,this purchase specially for my mother and also me as well. very handy to use and less the work laod of my mother. must buy this product for 3 to 5 persons family because this in our budget and very well build quality also in this price. first thing for this purchase the product in my mind the brand of samsung because i have all the appliances at my home is samsung and used many year without no complaint.,4.4
2003,"Play Video
 Very easy to use and looks great. It's not noisy or shaky if you place it in a flat surface. I was a bit doubtful after reading the reviews but I'm glad I went with my gut feeling. Clothes come out clean and fresh and the guy who had come for the demo was very helpful. Thanks for making life easyüôÇüôè",4.4
2004,The best thing about this washing machine is no vibrations on spinning but it will be not so attractive if you dont make it clean outside everyday but value for money at 12k budget,4.4
2005,There was a dent in the first one Amazon delivered and they sent a replacement that arrived in 2 days without too much fuss and with a convenient procedure. The machine itself is very good on all accounts.,4.4
2006,"Pros: Gives clean wash of clothes. Less noisy compare to other washing machine of same category. Daily usage is very easy and hassle free, best part is resume function in case of power facilities during a washing cycle.
Almost daily usage of this washing machine hardly put dent on electricity bills.

Cons: Water inlet pipe length is small.",4.4

A highly recommended product for everyone.",4.4
2011,It is perfect for me and my kids. Has all the necessary features required for small family like ours. More than worth the money paid. Go for it. !!! Installation services were also perfectly executed.,4.4
2012,"I have been using this product daily for the last few months and till now Iam satisfactory with the product. Only drawback with this machine is that, we wont be able to manually set the water level (incase of any water shortage). Water level is automatically set by the machine.",4.4
2013,"Recommended for everyday use. It does take up significantly more water. Spin dry cycle doesnt really clear out all water, it's not a big deal if you will eventually hang the clothes up to dry. Installation was easy(I was in a bind as old machine wasn't working and clothes were piling up) , I followed the instructions in the manual, and could do it myself.",4.4
2014,"* No installation charges
* machine takes 25-35 mins for one wash depending type selected.
* bought it for Rs 11500/- after cashback and discounts, so considering the price feel like gr8 deal
* Overall very happy with the purchase
* Can clean 8-10 garments(typically 700g jeans/300g shirt) in one wash easily so ideal for 3-4 ppl.
Some cons :
* Machine takes a little more amount of water and detergent than semi automatic .
* Require cleaning of tub after 8-10 washes
* Although the packaging box for the machine is not protected by any foam/thermocol sheet on the sides,Machine was in good condition ..delivered without any dents.(would suggest u have a look before u accept delivery)",4.4
2015,"My old washing Machine was Samsung too which still works fine despite more than 12 years of usage. This one is Value for Money. Easy to operate, nothing much has changed in the operations or interface in several years!
One thing I notice is that it appears that there‚Äôs no way to clear the previous memory, just in case. All you need to do is hit Cycle button and previous options are cleared, if they are still present despite you pressed Power Button previously. This point comes up only has a habit from my previous model usage, which would clear the memory after pressing Power Button.
Monsoon 15 or 30 mIn spin cycle options is still present and useful, though not that great. Nothing exceptional, but Value for money and suitable for small family on relatively tight budget.",4.4
2016,"I am writing this review after a week or so of usage. some pros and cons
Samsung is a great brand and has been improving all the time
Super quick delivery and installation ( just had to remind Cust Care to get it done !)
Ease of Use and similar to the old Samsung 6.2 kgs
Quick wash and uses lesser water than the older Samsung 6.2 Kgs
Exchange offer of Rs 1800 ! through Amazon / dealer provides only Rs 500 ! Exchange offer
Awesome product for the money paid !!!

Cons
Samsung 6.2 kgs bought about 10 years back is bigger than the present 6.5 kgs !
Slightly shakes when the clothes are less which i believe is normal for any washing Machine
Hence the rating of 4 star !",4.4
2017,"Very good product. Easy to use fully automatic. Noise level not that high, you need to adjust its base so that its in level and will not vibrate much. Little bit expensive. Also drain hole is in lowest side of machine and without any pumping motor. So you need to keep drain pipe lower than that. Overall its good purchase and value for money.",4.4
2018,"WM is good, not best. Samsung is definitely good brand. Machine quality is great. The sides are stainless steel but are thin sheets.
It‚Äôs a little complicated in beginning to understand. But then it‚Äôs very simple. Looks are very beautiful.

Not good parts

The machine drum spins less. It doesn‚Äôt spins for a whole round or two and changes direction. It feels like it‚Äôs week but it is not. But I think if it spins full it will be more powerful and effective.

Good buy and should go for it",4.4
2019,"First automatic washing machine in home. Quite easy to operate. As per user it consume bit more water as compare to semiautomatic.
Used only one time currently.
Overall nice experience while use.
Will share experience after sometime of usage .",4.4
2020,"After 2 week of usage my honest review-

One must remember that it has no memory, that means if power goes off then it will not be continuing from the same moment where it was obstructed. Although it will restart in that particular stage from beginnings.

Rat mesh quality is poor. It was already cracked when i opened the tub. It is very thin. Drainage pipe is very short. Although you can extend it by installing another pipe from market.

Delivery was on time. Product was Nicely packed.

Machine is durable and washing is up to the mark. It is gentle on clothes, It also has a delicate mode which washes soft clothes perfectly.

Overall I am satisfied with this product at this price range.

On can go for this for a family of 4-5.",4.4

 Edited my review after good after sales assistance from samsung. Good working washing machine at an attractive price. Only negative side is the noise and absence of hard wash/jeans mode. Had ordered it for home while I was away. Reuturned to find out this! Called samsung care they are not much of use.
Makes a lot of noise. Rather simpler modes and no jeans/hard wash mode.
Overall, go for it if this is your first fully automatic washing machine.",4.4
2022,"Easy to use washing machine and the Samsung technician is very good, supportive and knowledgeable.
However, the outer body is slightly damaged and the main root cause is the packaging from Samsung. Saving few bucks on appliance packaging is not only damaging the product but also the brand image of Samsung.",4.4
2023,It's a great product especially for the price tag. I had just one complaint regarding the front panel buttons. They are a bit cheap (quality wise). After a month I was a bit worried that they might stop working on pressing but it hasn't happened yet. But they definitely need a little bit of improvement. Rest everything is amazing including the service. The service guy arrived just one day after the delivery.,4.4
2024,Everything is good. But the washing machine doesn't have the option to increase the time. And doesn't have the option to use Strong wash. So the washing is normal is not very strong. The machine should give strong wash option as well so that if someone wants they can do the strong wash sometime as well.,4.4
2025,"Good product,but during delivery need to be more concise..bez after opening the box there was a small skratch on body only bez of transportation ignorance.but the skratch was nominal that's why I don't return back...

Hope the product will work well as my expectations",4.4
2026,"After a lot of research, I finalised this product. With amazon prime got the washing machine delivered within 24 hrs. That was super quick.

The Product is good, looks brilliant, and its various features quick wash, monsoon mode are a boon for users like me. Would recommend the product,however make sure with installation process as they don't cater to your timing convenience.",4.4
2027,"Ordered this in exchange of our old machine which was taken back at fair price of 1300 and the new machine is absolute value for money. Easy to use,convenient and smart to keep. Above all, unlike other brands it energy saving. Saves space and is absolutely good in quality.",4.4
2028,"Likes the product a lot especially under 14k it's best option but the drum size I feel is 6 instead of 6.5kg, it should be little more spacious that's why 4 star otherwise you can go for it.",4.4

So beware of this contradiction before purchase.",4.4

After making numerous calls and complaint requests, I was assured multiple times an engineer would come but never came. I've always been wary of Samsung products but this was the last straw. From now on I will try to avoid buying any Samsung product unless there's no better alternative. I will keep a 3 star for now until I see prolonged usage of this product. I absolutely don't recommend buying Samsung.",4.4

Wouldn't have bought if I had seen it during the purchase itself. Energy rating is not mentioned in the product description. It works fine. Not too many options in the board. Very few like normal and normal + soak, quick wash. Automatic water level picking. There is no aqua mode in this machine, where you can fill water and let the machine spin without taking by itself from the tap. Product got delivered as promised but service/installation was delayed by two weeks due to lockdown. My old machine was taken during the product delivery itself. So, we were left without an option but to fix the washing machine by ourselves. Another disappointment was that after I had bought it, the next day the price was dropped by 5%. Not so nice :)",4.4

I'll not buy Samsung products now.",4.4

The washing machine is definately a value for money with trust of samsung after sales network. There is no issue with the delivery and it was hassle free installation within a day of delivery.
There is no big noise whenever you machine operates. Some chim sound to notify you that buttons are being pressed, on/off and once it completes whole cycle it did the chim sound again. Overall nice operation and good amount of washing.
The machine dont have soft closing lid feature, and samsung guy told me that this particular machine didn't come with 10 years motor warranty. The 10 years warranty is for wobble technology one.
But yes, 2 years warranty for the machine is there which will get enabled automatically after the delivery.
Most importantly this machine dont have return facility but one can replace it with same machine again if there are some technical or physical flaws.",4.4

1.Energy star rating is three
2.memory backup is not available for power outage.

2164,"Product Description : 1 star
The product warranty in the Description section says 2 additional years for the motor, while the Features and Details section specifies 10 years warranty for the motor. Clearly there is a confusion in the details provided on Amazon site itself. On further checking with Samsung, they have confirmed that the product comes only with 2 years additional warranty on motor.

Price : 5 star
Received the product for a effective price of 10.7k during great Indian festival sale. It's a competitive price for a product from Samsung Brand.

Product : 3 star
Overall a average product. Water consumption is on a higher side. The wash cycle involves product rotating in clockwise direction for 180 degree followed by anti clockwise for another 180. In normal mode, the wash happens only for around 20mins which may not be sufficient at times and there is no other mode available to increase the wash duration. Also, since it's a 680 rpm motor, the drying is also not very effective.

Amazon and Samsung Support : 5 star
Installation was provided on the same day as delivery. Samsung Support responded to the query on warranty within 24hrs and Amazon support was co operative in accepting the product return for the difference in product description.

Overall : 1 star
You are not getting what you are promised with the warranty. Make sure you are ok with 2 years warranty before purchasing",4.4

However, Samsung customer care was not convinced by my complaint of horrible noise and rejected my request to return the product. Thereafter, i raised my issue with Amazon and they have understood my grievance and sent their own technician. The technician have checked the machine thoroughly and come to conclusion that it was some manufacturing defect due to which annoying noise was coming. And next day amazon arranged for pickup of the product and after 2- 3 hours of pickup money was transferred to my bank account.

I repeatedly called samsung but they denied to provide jobsheet and service denial request number as proof...and amazon kept on denying the return due to lack of jobsheet. So finally after so much of explanation and hassle, amazon decided to return and provide refund. But, this time they refunded a lesser amount. During kick-off of festival season sale for prime members, we were supposed to get 1750 rs instant bank discount, 1250 rs amazon pay cashback and 750 rs cashback by Cloudtail for this peoduct. I can understand during returning this product, they can deduct the bank diacount and cashback by seller but they shouldn't deduct the cashback of 1250 rs also....because I got the 1250 rs cashback as a result of ordering 3 items ar a time with total cart value of 30000. I should have been provided a cashback of proportionate to 13490 (actual price of this washing machine).
