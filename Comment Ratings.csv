9,"For a price this low along with exchange offer is a winner. No one likes to keep the old phone and buy a new one. If they dont the mobile phones will keep piling at home. I bought this for mywife and she is pretty pleased with the buy.

12,"I used to have a Motorola Moto G5S Plus phone as a secondary phone and recently i changed this to Redmi 9. Here are the advantages and disadvantages. This is assembled in India and is a good value for money offering.
Advantages
1) I wanted to replace the phone with the cheaptest entry point phone with a good display. The Redmi offer HD+ not full HD, but it is okay for my usage.
2) The MIUI is extremely pleasing to the eye and gives a good user experience.
3) The ease of set up of Redmi 9 was awesome. It was a dual SIM phone with Volte and 4 G SIM support on both SIM
4) Also we can extend the existing 64 GB storage with upto 512 GB SD card, I have procured another 64 GB storage
5) It has an FM radio thrown in as well.
6) The camera is okay not highly fancy similar to the Redmi 9 Power, but this being a secondary phone I am okay with the overal performance.

Disadvantages
1) The charger is the only mini USB and wish this was a USB C type charge with quick charge.
2) The Wifi detects only 2.4 GHz and not the latest 5GHz hence the overall connectivty speed is low.

For the price point that is 2500 Rs less due to exchange and overall pay out to be around 6150 Rs, this phone is a value for money offering. At the time of buying this was the top phone in the Amazon phone range, but given a choice would have opted for Redmi 9 Power, that had a better feature.",5.0

If you are bying it for regular uasge like calls, watching YouTube and whatsapp then it's good. Don't consider this phone for gaming or heavy usage as it lags then. I hav bought this phone for my son for his online classes, calls and for YouTube videos so it's working fine.",5.0

2: Also in the mobile industry every thing changes so dynamically that sky rocket configurations and prices have no limits hence sticked to this fix budget of INR 10K and features to an extent to conclude the purchase.
3: Orange Color is quiet charming and pleasant to opt as well.",5.0
20,"Fast Fingerprint reader, large and clear screen, huge battery, overall well built. I choose this for my girlfriend, she doesn't play heavy games, for that matter she doesn't play any games on smartphons, so the Helio G35 with 4gb ram and 64gb storage is more then enough for her Facebook insta, and the 6.57inch HD display is also great for her nonstop Netflix and other media consumptions. She actually needed a phone with big screen and finger print security. Plus good battery life and no lags. So redmi 9 was a great gift for her. I myself use Realme x2pro because I'm a heavy user so that super amoled fhd+ 90hz display is a sureshot nessesity for me and a phone with the Snapdragon 855+ processer was what I was looking for under 35k. First I thought to buy her some similar phone but than I thought why? She don't need that much powerful phone, so I gave her exactly what she needed. Huge screen, huge battery, good camera decent processer, 4gb ram. For her multitasking and 64gb storage for all her photos songs and videos and yea it has option for expanding the memory too which my phone doesn't have so I have to stick to the 128gb only.",5.0
21,"Its a great phone but don't buy Acko insurance with it as theyvare fraud.
I bought the insurance with the phone, I got a message from Acko to register and I did. I saw the insurance being activated on my number and the device but the very next day without any reason they cancelled it themselves . Then it was a fight between them and Amazon. Amazon suggest to buy the insurance again which I did and again Acko denied it as it was not bought with the phone. I just feel its a fraud going on, they generate interest with insurance with phone and later cheat like this. DONT BUT ACKO insurance",5.0
22,"I bought this for my nani quality is great even i tried some gsmes like wcc3 abd wcc2 it handels perfectly but at low setting, according to price mobile is awesome battery backup in 6 - 8 days if only use for calling and if you are multitasker then easily last for 1-1.5 day on heavy to moderate use, now coming to camera the camera is not ss great but i got this for 8000 it worth every penny i spend you can't accept a flagship level camera at this price, if you are a camera lover just don't buy but if you want big storage big battery abd classy looks and a trusted brand just go for it you will not regret at your decision. Handels multitasking easily but not a gaming processor, you can use 10 apps wp, fb, YouTube and all without any lag issue. Phone doesn't heat that's good. Great quality mobile at affordable price thanku MI. And Amazon",5.0
23,I am so addicted to Amazon now that I don't even remember half my orders. They just come and I take them. It's that simple. This product had a exchange option where i had to return my older phone. No problems. The entire process took 10 mins. The executive came took my phone check a few things and game me the new phone and left. Amazing !!,5.0

 Let’s make one thing clear immediately: the Xiaomi Redmi 9 is a phone with flaws, and it has a lot of them. On the other hand, it is one of the most affordable phones available anywhere right now, and it's hard to find a better phone at this price point.The screen is of barely acceptable quality, the camera is disappointing, and the performance is middling at best, and yet, the Redmi 9 counters these with its superb design, good feature set, long battery life, and finally, the biggest ace in its sleeve — the ultra-affordable pricing. Let that sink in — the Redmi 9 starts at less than 9000, This alone offsets all of the flaws that the phone has in store for us. Or does it? Let's look at the the many, many corners that have been cut to achieve this pricing
🇩 🇪 🇸 🇮 🇬 🇳
Plastic is fantastic, especially on affordable phones, and the Redmi 9 once again proves that. The textured back of the Redmi 9 feels great in the hand and provides excellent grip when used naked, though I’d still recommend putting a case on. I actually quite like the textured back of the device, which not only helps with the grip, but also adds a certain ""cool"" factor to the device, and no, I have zero issues with the fact that I'm touching plastic. What’s more, plastic keeps the weight below 200 grams, which is admirable for such a large device with its humongous 5,020mAh battery. Don’t get me wrong, it’s still a big and heavy phone, but it doesn’t strike as such. Overall, the Redmi 9 is a joy to handle, despite its large dimensions.
🇩 🇮 🇸 🇵 🇱 🇦 🇾
The display of the Redmi 9 is pretty average. Sure, it’s large and spacious with its 6.53-inch diagonal, and the resolution is more than sufficient, but it’s an LCD FHD+ display with bleak colors, low brightness, and disappointing contrast. The display is lackluster, and I didn’t enjoy it at all during my time with the phone. You will also have a hard time under bright sunlight, as it’s just not bright enough.
🅱🅰🆃🆃🅴🆁🆈
The battery backup, fortunately, is spectacular on the Redmi 9. With the phone's fairly efficient hardware, the large, 5,020mAh battery takes a long while to drain. You can rest assured it will last you for a long time; in my experience, two days of usage were guaranteed. In our custom battery tests, the phone lasted for a combined time of 10 hours and 14 minutes, which is one of the best results we've seen so far in 2020. Charging, however, is pretty slow — the 10W charger included in the box topped up the Redmi 9 in 168 minutes, or 2 hours and 48 minutes. That's slow, but then again, what else did you expect?
🅲🅰🅼🅴🆁🅰
There are three cameras on the Redmi 9: a 13MP main, an 8MP ultra-wide, a 5MP macro camera, and a 2MP depth sensor. You can also shoot at 2X, but don't get fooled, it's merely a digital zoom solution. There’s an 8MP selfie camera up front, and video quality tops up at 1080p at 30fps",5.0

For their usage (mostly watching youtube, whatsapp, zoom calls, MS teams, and other common applications) this has been a good gadget. With 126GB internal memory, this phone is not going to indicate memory low even if they receive 100s of social media forwards and voice notes.

66,"Bought in october 2020. One day delivery from amazon, great as always. Using the device since then, so here is the detailed review of redmi 9.

- Built quality is good overall. Feels a midrange smartphone and a bit bulky in hand, due to plastic back. But other than that, phone is built decent.

- Processor stack (Helio G35) is mediocre, to get the job done. Provides adequate performance, nothing too fancy there.

- Having a battery of 5000 mAh, it lasts roughly around whole day while performing day to day activities like streaming, browsing and downloading. Never tested games on it. So, performance might differ in that case. While charging device heats up significantly, while taking from 0% it took 5 hours to make it 100% as its bundled with 10W slow charger.

- The IPS HD+ display is doing well, I haven't got any issues regarding color accuracy, saturation or viewing angles as of now.

- Speakers are decent, not that great. Call quality and cellular reception is good, on par with the other alternatives.

- All Mi phones has the same issues in software part as this one also having MIUI, packed with a lot of bloatware and stuff. Security patches are updated regularly, but the overall update cycles are indefinite and after an update some features just stops working randomly. After OTA update, phone dropped signal, kept restarting, keyboard is not appeared when focused on an inputbox, etc etc. Overall an laggy android experience.

- Camera is really disappointing. Not good at all, the daylight images are bad, HDR is not working properly. Images taken in night are even worse.

These are the things I have found during 5 months of usage. Thanks",4.0
67,"Let's start with the pros:
A really good battery. Easily runs for an entire day in higher than average use. Lightweight, Sleek, Has smooth fingerprint sensor, loud and has a really good processor if you're a game lover. The photos despite twin cam setup are good and only get grainy in low light. Use pro-mode if you want the best output.

Cons:
No type C charge or Fast Charge Support. Could have been better had there been tri cam setup like Poco C3 (it lacks FingerPrint Sensor though). Non Stock Android is a turn off as phones like Moto G10 Power and many other have either Stock Android or lesser bloatwares while MIUI is notorious with its UI.

Summary: Go for it if you're MIUI user as it will feel very homely. Also, if you are a game lover an want something under 10K, this is one of the options you should go for. Don't opt for it if you're hardcore into photography.

76,Display better for this price but if you can spend a 1000 rupees more go for Redmi 9 Prime which has better FHD display and good processor than this.

4. 5000 mAh battery ( however the chipset consume more battery as compared to SD with 4000mAh battery will perform the same)

107,"If there is an option I would 3.5

It's been 2 days since I got the phone and here are positive and negatives with comparison to Redmi 8a Dual (my previous phone)

Battery Charging: first 30-40% is very quick in charging. But to get it fully charged it takes almost an hour.

Battery Life: It runs for more than 24 hours once fully charged even if you use it to watch movies and games.

Negative : phone gets heated up while charging if you leave it on cushion type surfaces like bed, sofa etc. Irrespective of the surface phone gets a little bit heated up every time you charge it. And if you try answering a call or use the phone while on charge get ready for hand and ear burning sensation.

This is not observered in Redmi 8a Dual. But the battery life is less competed to Redmi 9. If you are a person who uses mobile while on charge, then I won't recommend Redmi 9.

Camera Quality: if you are buying this phone for Camera.. DO NOT. Redmi 8a Dual has better selfi and rear camera quality. Selfie camera is worst and rear works on in perfect lighting and when you try to zoom on objects it looses it's quality.

Storage: Go for it.

Volume: Good but when compared to Redmi 8a dual it's little bit low.

Overall if Redmi 8a Dual is much better than Redmi 9. Except for the storage and battery life.",3.0

battery backup excelent,
Daily usage good,
Gaming experience Laggy PUBG, Call of Duty is almost not possible to play in this game,

Chinese's knows well how to attract Indians, Camera Megapixel, Camera filter, sound, Big screen and very common attractive looks.

Most of the people mentioned the camera is not good. I believe a 13mp camera is good for me but I never expected the camera quality to be this much worse.

If you want to purchase a phone specifically for photography then I strongly recommend please go with some other phones.

- Orange Back different from that shown in product pictures. Not attractive.

- No battery charging indicator light.
Once the mobile goes in sleep mode, you cannot figure if it is charging or not.

- Defective Sound System : volume is generally low. No Bass At All. Sound Volume goes up and down on its own while playing songs/video.

- Extremely Short (half meter) charging cable

- Micro-USB B-type port

- Outdated handset. Not worth the money.

- No RETURN Option despite receiving defective piece

- No Option to schedule technician visit before replacement window closes (all slots permanently full)

Stuck with a defective handset.
No scope of Return & purchasing another model.

159,"Purchased this around may end and got it delivered by June 1st week 2021 and I am writing this review on 2nd September 2021. So basically I have used this for 3 months. I am not someone who uses phone for gaming or prolong use. I use it just for calls, message,mails, WhatsApp and payment. That's it. Not even fb, insta, Netflix, prime, nothing. So I have basic uses. Still this phone started showing problems in less than 3 months. Problems that the phone showed in less than 3 months:
1) It has started slowing down
2) the charger wire has loosened up and I had to use a spare one which I had
3) the phone is so heavy that when you hold your phone in your hand for long calls like 30 mins call without using earphone, or if you chat for some 15-20 mins, your wrist will hurt, I got carpal tunnel syndrome by using this just for 3 months and planning to get a minor surgery soon. It's weight is more than one plus series phones.
4) the worst camera quality I have ever seen.

One can think to buy this for urgent use or for very short term use. I had to buy this when my samsung phone got into a drain and I really needed one asap and during May month all shops were closed for 2nd wave of covid.

He tried to power on mobile, as I already said this mobile is not powering on. He started argument without IMEI varification I will not give you the replacement. My question is here if mobile is dead then how and why he was insisting. Did customer care support team have raised proper request for replacement. Carrier guy cancel my replacement. I called again to customer care I explained everything and they said once replacement cancelled. We can only refund. I accepted that preposal as well. Same thing happened here again when carrier guy came to my home same question asked for IMEI varification I need to power on mobile.boss if phone is dead then how you will varify.

250,"This is my first OnePlus mobile so I can't compare with other OnePlus mobiles.

Pros:

120hz display for smoother display and touch experience

Fast charging : 0 - 100 % within an hour in optimzed charging mode (else it'll charge in 40 mins, I didn't try it). Battery backup is also very good.

No curved display : Personally I like flat displays as curved one is more prone to get cracks and damage easily

Case and Screen protector : you will get case in the box and Screen protector already applied to mobile which are of very decent quality.

Oxygen 11: comes with Android 11 based Oxygen 11 OS and features are very cool.

Performance : I have been using it from last 4 days but didn't notice any lags. But I am not a gamer so Can't say how it performs while gaming.

Misc: Watched a water durability test video which claims it's water resistant but there is no official IP rating on it. Front and back side of the mobile are protected by Corning gorilla glass 5.

Rest all specs like 5g, 865 Snapdragon, RAM, Storage, Camera setup,Full aluminium body etc are similar to OnePlus 8.

During sale got the mobile with 1 year screen protection plan from ACKO without any extra cost.

Cons:

Front camera : I felt selfie camera quality could have improved. Looks like software issue, hope OnePlus will fix it in their future updates.

Wide angle camera : Needs some improvement.

Monochrome camera : I don't think so it's useful, anyone can apply filter and convert the picture to B/W. For the sake of quad camera it's just present.

I don't see any other cons, I hope the software issues for cameras that I mentioned in the cons section will get fixed in future s/w updates. Really it's a great mobile.

While using the phone in real life, there will be 0 lag, excellent RAM management, and excellent battery life.

The charging is blazing fast and that's what we expect from this 65 watt charger.
I have charged the phone to 100% on Monday 2 PM and my battery is at 32% on Tuesday 10AM while writing this review. To tell you the truth, I have never experienced this kind of battery backup previously.

I have played few games like FIFA and COD and they were smooth as butter.

The phone produces excellent color and brightness. Tested the camera on some subjects, and I am very happy with the camera performance so far.

Overall, this phone is a beast and it will definitely change your day to day experience. Gamers will definitely like this phone as there are no heating issues while playing and 120hz refresh rate makes everything very smooth.

* Oxygen OS
* Good battery easily lasting for 1.5 days
*Fast charging speed is crazy (charging 0 to 100% in 40 mins) and no the phone doesn't get hot while the charger heats up a bit which is expected

*5G (although it will only useful in the future)
*Wifi 6 and Bluetooth 5.1

257,"I've been owning the OnePlus 5T for almost three years. I still remember getting it from first ever sale on the November of 2017. It was one of the best looking and feeling phone of its time. Even after three years of usage, the phone still feels new and fast. It was adequate for my daily usage and the processing power was more than what I needed. I never had the temptation to update my OnePlus 5T until the day I broke the glass on my 5T😭💔. The phone fell straight on its face breaking the front glass of the display and the corner is chipped and has glass fragments in it. Though the touch and display has no problems, I often see shards of glass falling off from the phone which isn't safe for something which is in your pocket for most of the time. I decided it's time to change.

I was initially looking to get an OnePlus 8 as I am a big fan of that curved display. The 8 was indeed a very good pick for my budget as it had everything that I needed and more. As I was reading through endless reviews of the 8, I came across a news about the rumours on the 8T. Since I had a spare phone on me, I decided to wait until the release of the 8T. On October 14, I saw the official unveil of the 8T and I initially thought the 8T wasn't a big upgrade to the 8. So I thought may be I should settle on the 8, but then I remembered what happened with my 5T. I also read that curved displays are more susceptible to damage even from small accidental drops. So I made up my mind and decided to go with the 8T.

I ordered the phone through Amazon and it was delivered the very next day. The package was bigger than I expected. I didn't have much expectations during the unboxing. The aquamarine green color that I went with has a slight bluish tint to it. It isn't super reflective nor too matte. It has a very subtle gloss to it which doesn't attract too much fingerprints. Holding the phone on hand, I realised that it's a bit thicker and heavier than what I am used to (5T is the thinnest flagship made by OnePlus IMO👀). But in-hand, it feels solid.

Holding the power button, the phone came to life greeting me with the Hello screen and I started setting it up. As soon as I touched the screen, I felt that smooth 120 Hz display in action which makes the phone feel blazingly fast. This is a huge upgrade to me personally coming from 60 Hz. The Colors on the display pops and it is one of the best AMOLED panels out there. Personally, I had an issue with the 5T where the screen has a slightly warmer tint. It was showing while editing on Snapseed and Lightroom. But the 8T doesn't have any such issues. The display is spot on! I had an update waiting for me as soon as I finished the setup. It was for the camera, network and battery optimization. I updated the phone before starting to use it as anyone would like a bug free experience in a new device.

The Oxygen OS 11 on top of Android 11 makes the user experience very pleasing and it is good for one handed usage for most of daily tasks. Scrolling on the 120 Hz is phenomenal and no words could describe it until you experience it in person. You would never have the heart to go back to 60 Hz. Oxygen OS 11 also offers a plethora of features such as Zen mode, Game Space, Insight Ambient display etc. They are very intuitive and enhances the user experience.

Charging on the 65W Warp charger is a blissful experience even if you are coming from older OnePlus devices (Dash or Warp 30). It reaches 100% in 40 mins which is the time you'll spend on your morning routines. So you're good to go for the entire day if you just charge it in the morning. Battery life is also very good as I'm getting approximately 5 and a half hours of screen on time until the charge drops to 15%.

Another major area of improvement is on the videography capabilities. Inclusion of portrait video mode, super stable mode, night mode video has made the video side of things very interesting. The edge detection on the portrait video works very well on slow moving and stationary subjects. 4k @ 60 and 1080p @ 240 has made videos so much usable as you could slow the videos on post and it could be stable than most. OIS also works very well. But, I feel the photography side of things could use a little tweaking on the image processing and overall white balance and contrast. The wide angle camera and the main sensor takes exceptional pictures in good lighting, but they struggle from over tinted greeny images on low light. It feels as if they are wearing night vision goggles. I hope this would be fixed on their next update. Inclusion of a macro lens is good, but for macro photography, I feel that you would need atleast a 12MP as the pictures look digitally over-sharpened on the 5MP unit.

Over-all, it's a worthy buy for the money.",5.0
258,"Pro -
- One of the Best Display with brightness upto 1100 nits . ( Fluid Amoled the same display Samsung uses in its S20 Ultra, it's far better than Super Amoled display)
- Oxygen Os Smoothness and Speed.
- Fast Charging.
- Great Selfie Camera.
- Vapour Chamber for Cooling.
- One of the Fastest Chipset.
- 120hz butter smooth Display.
- Stereo Speakers.

Con -
- Old Camera Sensor = Though I seriously like the Camera, I got the first Update and there was a lot of improvement in overall picture quality, ofcourse If You will Compare it with IPhone definitely You will find some thing missing. Overall the Cameras are awesome, it satisfied My needs.

### For those Who are comparing it with Samsung S20 FE, Google Pixel 4a and Mi10T Pro ###

> Samsung S20 FE - It has Exynos(4G), which is Trash and there's no way it can compete it with the SD865 (5G).

> Google Pixel 4a - Poor battery life, heating issues, Plastic body, Small Screen, Cameras are good but You can't Zoom in due to Low Pixels, hangs or heats up too much while doing heavy task or while gaming or while using multiple social media apps.

> Mi10T Pro - Bad display ( only IPS LCD no AMOLED), MIUI contains too much Advertisements ( everytime You install or open or even use the Phone an advertisement will pop-up from nowhere), Poor Cooling management for 144hz gaming.

260,"I got it on16th October via one day delivery.
So after using 3 days I am writing this review.

As far as the display, it is very smooth we can really feel the difference between 60hz screen & 120hz screen. We can easily look at the screen clearly even in the sunlight, thanks to one plus for increasing brightness nits upto 1090. So display is very smooth, you will love it.

Also, the latest processor SD865 performs very good. I played COD Mobile. The experience was awesome. Gaming was smooth. It also comes with Game Space that allows us to play games peacefully. While gaming or charging it heats a little but which is negligible as temp. (39-41 deg. Celcius) is very low as compared to other devices.

Camera is very good. But there is not latest sensor. If provided it could be great. But difference is noticable only when you zoom image to final level or you are a camera freak.
It is almost as good as OP8, I have to say a little better than OP8. But not better than OP8 Pro. But a normal person like me who uses camera occasionally, it does not make any difference.

I prefer latest processor and display.

It also includes Oxygen OS & Android 11 out of the box which makes it again more interesting due to its awesome features.

269,"I've been waiting for this phone's release from one month because I didn't want to buy One Plus 8 because of the curved display and..I was not disappointed...
-*Display* is awesome...better than one plus 8 because I've heard that they've improved the brightness levels
-*120Hz Refresh rate*....although 90hz is more than enough but in gaming and some other areas 120hz will be usefull...
-*4500mah battery* is enough for our daily usage but ...you know 120hz will drain the battery faster when compared with 60hz and 90hz ..but you'll get 5-6 hours screen time easily in 120hz too
-*65W charging*...woah full charging in less than 45 min ... I've kept charging at 1:10am at 18% and started surfing Instagram by the time 1:50am it was 99%..lol..
-*Cameras*... I've shared some samples.. pls don't judge by those photo's because I've captured those pics 5mim before writing this review only..but they came pretty good..those were just clicked casually..but if you use them properly you'll get better pics..and they've improved the camera software and Ive heard it is better than one plus 8... they've improved ultra wide and macro camera also
-*Oxygen OS*..you know Oxygen OS is awesome..I've upgraded from MiUI and I can find so much difference..no ads at all and clean software..no blotware...they have even removed Facebook lol..only Google apps and Amazon were pre installed...You can even buy oneplus phones for Oxygen OS only..it is that good
-*Gaming*.. Snapdragon 865 will handle almost every game pretty well.. battery drain is also less while I'm playing Pubg and other games
-Phone is very good looking and very comfortable to carry
Finally I'm happy with my purchase and specs wise it is better than OnePlus 8..But it is your wish because some feel curved display are more premium so if you like curved display you can take one plus 8..but if you're ok with any type of screen then you should definitely pick 8T over 8 ....because 8T has better specs in almost every aspect",5.0

1. This have glass back so its too slippery. (Use protective case, use soft case)
2. The colour aquamarine green is sick. This one is glossy. My friend bought the lunar silver one, that's matte finish.
Summary-
Great performance, good enough camera and the 65watt charge is also fast it takes max 44-45min to charge 0-100% . *Oneplus give software update fast to upgrade ta camera quality*",5.0
274,"Pros:
-OnePlus tag
-120hz display is Buttery smooth!
-Camera, I will be honest... it's a very good camera but could have been better.. I'm sure through updates it will improve!
-battery it's super fast thanks to 65w charger !
-The haptic's in this device is well balanced and it is well pronounced!
-Design and in hand feel is just amazing.
Cons:
-Camera (it's a con for those who want the bestest camera out there...and this is simply not the best)
-No IP rating
-No wireless charging (which I couldn't care less)",5.0
275,"Well you must already know the specifications of this device by now and this device is a beast.
it took me less than 3 min to download and install around 40 apps
i would suggest you go with the 12gb RAM variant
120Hz display is butter smooth and you do notice the difference between a 60hz and a 120hz display
I was a little skeptical about the camera performance but if you are not a photographer this camera is more than enough for you
Battery life is pretty good
It will easily last you for a day but keep in mind that this is not a two days device
Charging speed is just unreal it charges to 100% in 45 min which is insane
Connectivity A+ no issues there
Just one concern- they should have given the type-c to 3.5mm dongle

so just go for it
its a great deal",5.0

Only issue is we cant record calls automatically. But all in all a perfect phone to have in this range.
Dont think. Go for it. Oneplus is oneplus.",5.0
278,"Honestly I would have never ever imagined to switch brands..!!
Ive been an die hard fan of Samsung and have only been using the Note Series since 10 years
I had confusion between the Galaxy Note 20 Ultra or One Plus 8T
And i am glad i made the right choice♥️♥️

First impressions the colour i am Awee Struck
Aquamarine Green like the most amazing colour ever😍😍
The Design is so simple yet so cleanly crafted. The 6.55inch Display which fits perfectly in your hand

My 1st Day of Extensive usage of the phone with more then 12hrs of bluetooth handset connected and constant data usage it lasted more then 14hrs which is pretty good✌🏻

I made sure to drain the whole battery and charge it to full for a 2nd day run
And guess what...with the same extensive usage by the end of nearly 14 hrs the battery still lasted to 20%
(Note:- The Above details i tested in Refresh rate of 60Hz ...yes its not like 120Hz but its still good)

Take a look at the screenshot of how one can improve their battery life...!!
At almost 24hrs of battery life and still 3hr remaining 😍😍🤩🤩

The 65W Warp Charge.. i just dont have any words about that...its the Craziest thing ever ever ever seen in any Smartphone..From 0 to 100 in nearly 32min...YAAWIEE WOWWIEE😍🤩

Camera Quality is pretty decent 😅
The quad cameras gives the amazing feel
One Plus still needs to tweek with good camera updates!!!

(The very 1st startup after entering your google id it will restore all the data with a rapid speed
So yes because of that the phone will get heated up..!! But dont be disappointed just do what i did drain the whole battery to 0 and charge it)

Oxygen Os..well my 1st impression not bad at all. It has its own unique features.
Not like Samsung's One UI 2.1 but still decent😅

Overall i am happy with the phone and good for the next 3 years atleast🥳😅🥰😻❤️🔥",5.0
279,"I upgrade this phone from my oneplus 7. I am a huge fan of oneplus phones since oneplus 3. As always this is the best product till date.

1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.

2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.

3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.

4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.

5 Camera: It's good for the price, but it is not as great as its competitor flagship phones.

280,"I have moved from iOS to Android and trust me to have this beast during the transition phase is an absolute pleasure. Display is amazing, 120 hgz refresh rate really does the job in terms of your viewing experience going to the next level. I don't play games but usually keep on checking emails,chats etc as part of work and this is much better than an iPhone where in entire day was spent on charging the phone. Camera is superb as well. To sum up its indeed is a great buy.",5.0
281,"This review is from a normal user, a working personal.
Best useful feature for me is fast charging. Amoled display is noticeably better than IPS LCD. Camera is surely better than most phones under 30k. Phone is very fast. And phone speakers are very loud and clear. Audio quality is also superb. Most importantly if you're just a normal user who mainly use phone for calls, checking social media, occasionally clicking snaps then I don't suggest to buy expensive phone. 20k phones are enough for that kind of usage. High spec phones are for hard-core users and gamers.",5.0
282,"The OnePlus 8T cuts the right corners, keeps the right premium features and packages it all in a gorgeously looking piece of glass that feels more ready-to-be-used than any other phone. It’s the most reliable, most user-friendly OnePlus so far. It’s absolutely worth its price and it is a 10/10 device.
.
👉 Stellar performance. 120Hz + 865 + 12GB RAM + 3.1 makes the 8T an absolute beast.
OxygenOS 11 delivers stellar performance and feels more natural than ever. Being the only android phone with Android 11 out-of-the-box is an icing on the cake.
👉 Great camera. It performs just as good as 8 Pro (considering 8T is much cheaper), even the 5MP lens is surprisingly capable, I use the B/W cam a lot actually. Throw almost anything at the camera and it will be handled with care. Images come out very well-balanced, the camera is reliable in every case and if you know how to work the exposure settings, you will not miss a thing.
👉 WARP Charge 65 is the best innovation since high refresh rates. Having the freedom to have your phone fully charged in half an hour is truly luxurious and makes your life much better. Battery life is quite great & the best in any OnePlus device till now.
👉 Price. It's a flagship level OnePlus phone that is fully worth its money at 46/43k
👉The phone is packed with several other features like the Always on Display & the standard OnePlus Alert slider which will make your day to day usage much better.
.
As a personal advice I will suggest you to go for the 12/256 version as you may regret not spending that extra 3k later.
.
And don't believe whatever these so called reviewers are saying about OnePlus 8T as I found out from my personal experience that all of them were highly biased and wrong in most aspects. You can buy this phone blindly and you will never regret it.",5.0
283,"The yay factors!
🔵The display is flagship quality even we can compare it with high end flagships.
🔵Stereo Speakers are good enough for watching movies!
🔵Build quality is great!
🔵 Oxygen OS Is fast and fluid in android 11
🔵Alert slider is Awesome!
🔵Gaming performance Is Great!
🔵Signal Reception and Connectivity is great!
🔵 Battery life was initially below average but the updates I received made it good enough!
🔵 Aquamarine Green is glossy but surprisingly it is not a fingerprint magnet.
🔵65w charging is blazingly fast
Charges 0-100 in just about 40 mins

The Nay factors:
🔴 camera quality is average comparing flagships but people switching from budget phones feel this as a good camera!
🔴Apart from ultrawide, the other camera sensors are gimmicks
🔴Absence of 3.5 mm jack
🔴No IP rating but survived few splashes in rain
🔴The long term effect of the 65w charger in the battery health is questionable.
🔴The Bitmoji AOD Feature is still not available as of December 1

Pro tip: use Gcam instead of Stock Camera
For Better picture quality!",5.0
284,"This is my first one plus device and I mus say I am impressed. I have received this device on 18th oct and have been using this for past 7 days. Here are my two cents-
Pros-
1. Buttery smooth performance. 120hz is a treat
2.Fluid amoled display- great colors and contrast
3. Camera is pretty good in day light conditions and there are ample settings available including pro mode (f1.7 aperture)
4.Charging speed is phoenamenal. Love the warp charge 65

Cons:
1. While setting up the device, phone did get quite heated and os gave warning. It basically happened during app transfer from my old device. Although after that even during charging I never saw temperature going above 40. With normal to heavy usage it remains under 40 degrees which is good.
2. Low light camera performance is noisy.although with nightscape one can take decent photos.
3. Few apps such as Kotak Mahindra are not working on android 11/oxygen 11

With that being said I didn't notice anything else- no black crush,green tint or purple tint/banding. All good. In this price segment, it is well justified phone.",5.0
285,"I am posting my review after using 30 days
Coming to PRO's:
1.Screen Quality is Good ( No tints) (120hz is butter smooth) ( very very thin borders )
2.Fast charging is amazing , full charge in less than 40 mins ( pls nibba's to enjoy fast charging disable optimised charging in settings)
3.Battery life is good , simply lasts a day ( SOT purely depends on user usage)
4.Sound Quality is good enough and as well loud enough, you will love them.
5.Build quality is good , ( slim, weight distribution is top notch)
6.Android 11 out of the box means you can get an extra android verson update compared to oneplus 8 and 8 pro ***

Cons:

1.Camera on paper does not beat competition and 2 years old ( working 2 years on same camera made OnePlus awesome futures like ""video in nightsite"" ""portrait video "" both features doing well) (3&4 th camera modules- seriously OnePlus you are better than this )
2.Gorilla glass 5 on front and Back ( you can go for 6 this time)
3.Lpddr4x ram ( where mi 10 and find X2 using lpddr5 ram)
4. Only two color options avilable
5. OnePlus dailer and message apps is replaced by ugly looking Google dailer and Google message app

Opinions:

1.In past 30 days I never regret for my decision choosing OnePlus 8t over OnePlus 8 ( except using ugly Google dailer and message app)
2. The nibba's and nibbi's talking about several bugs those are all not 8t bugs , seriously those are android 11 beta bugs which can be cleared by system updates and OnePlus is very seriously working on 8t updates ( i got 4 system updates in 30 days 😄 insane) when u r accessing early stuff there will be risks👍.

288,"Writing this review after using the phone for one week. Thanks to one plus for bringing a high end phone with a flat display. This is one of the best devices you can get around 40k budget considering its specs. Major Pros and Cons listed below
Pros:
1. Fast Charging - 40 mins from 0-100 and more than 50% in 20 mins.
2. 120Hz refresh rate - Feels super smooth and the FHD+ AMOLED panel is excellent.
3. Compact and light design - Weighs only 188gms and is easy for one handed use due to thin long 20:9 aspect ratio screen.
4. Dual speakers, singnal reception, network speeds etc... are all flagship level.

Cons:
1. Heating while playing games - Did notice heating while playing asphalt 9 and pes 2021. Temperature reaches about 42°C in 20 mins gaming.
2. Camera setup is not good - Disappointed with the main camera and ultrawide photos. Both these cameras struggles at different loghting conditions and the colors are way off. Video capturing and stability with the vidoes are okay. 5MP macro camera and the selfie camera are somewhat good.
3. Battery life while using 120hz is just okay for heavy users. It will not last a full day but a 15 mins top up with the speed charger will help.
4. Not so impressive in benchmarks - may be due to LPDDR4X ram, benchmark scores are not the highest when compared to the other flagships that uses new DDR5 rams.",5.0

292,"Right of the bat, I would like to list the slightly bad thing about the phone which is pretty much the camera. It does the job though. It's a pretty decent camera which will practically do anything you might want to do in your day to day use. If you just want to professionally shoot pictures, just buy a camera.

Now that the camera is out of the way, I think there is nothing where OnePlus is lacking. The display is absolutely gorgeous (and it's FLAT). The bezels are thin and sweet. The performance is absolutely crushing any other phone in this range (at par with the flagships). The feel of the phone in the hand and looks are just great. The 120Hz feels very smooth. And finally, the Oxygen OS is gorgeous.

I would say if you are looking for a phone which has the best camera, this is not it. But if you are okay with a decent camera, this phone is an absolute beast everywhere else.",5.0

297,"I read lot of reviews and all but it's my opinion

What I like:
- It's the fastest charging I've seen (0-100 less than 40 min)
- Signal reception(Data speeds), I don't about how Apple, Samsung or any other flagships handle this (but one plus nailed it)(well I'm only talking about 4G, don't know about 5G).
- Camera (Lot of people saying there are better options for me it's more than enough, Well I'm not a camera freak)
- Display is good(don't know whether it's the best, but if it's in 120Hz mode battery is draining faster Currently I'm using 60Hz mode I'm getting almost a full day(12-18hrs screen time) in 60, but not in 120 it around 6-8 hrs screen time).

What I dont like:
- Weight
- I actually like smaller screens but yeah I can adjust with it.
- It's heating (I'm not sure about the measurements but I can feel that heat) when browsing a lot, downloading big files, the hotspot, little gaming(coc), and charging (In the youtube reviews they're saying it's fine but for me I don't feel like it's fine.)",5.0
298,"By reading the other reviews, I don't understand how people are facing so many issues some looks fake to me.

However its been 15days now since i am using this device and following are my observations

PS:- I am transitioning to this device from my Oneplus 6 before that i used oneplus 2 & 3 so this is my 4th Oneplus device

1) Display 120hz pretty smooth and fluid, you wont be able to switch back to 60hz now. Pro or Con you decide 😅

2) Performance is top notch (mine is 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage variant) so no complaints on that.

3) Camera is not bad, pictures are of good quality in both normal and night mode, but if you are a pro photographer and need pro features then camera is not for you, for a regular user this is good.

4) Battery: Backup is way too good as compared to my OP6, the battery last easily for a day with regular usage it gives me around 7 hrs of SOT, but while playing heavy games like COD it gives you 5 hrs straight gameplay on a full charge (Rarely people does this until you have lots of free time 😝). Anyways when the battery juice is low it takes just 30-35mins to full charge which is the best feature for me.

5) Networking:- Although we cannot test the 5G yet in India but i have noticed the Wifi speed and mobile network speed is slightly improved from my previous OP6.

6) Software: Well Oneplus is always best in the software updates, however initially this new Oxygen OS 11 was a bit annoying compared to the previous versions, but it slowly grows up to you with the usage and u actually start liking it, there were few bugs and issues which oneplus is fixing with the regular updates and as even i am a Software Engineer the issues are understandable 😝, (i received 2 updates in 15 days) so software will definitely keep on improving which is a plus point with oneplus.

7) Pricing:- Considering Oneplus is a brand now hence this price is justified. There are other phones with similar specs priced within 40K but they are not Oneplus, so just like Samsung and Apple you are now paying slightly higher for Oneplus.

8) Design:- The only reason i dint bought Oneplus 8 Pro is because i dint liked its design, with Oneplus 8T that was fixed so 5/5 for design from my side.",5.0
299,"Review after 8 days~
OnePlus 8T Aquamarine Green (12gb/256gb)
This is the best phone you can get for your money,
I upgraded from OnePlus 6t to OnePlus 8t and there are many subtle tweaks and upgrades,

1.)The haptic feedback is top notch now
2.)Punch Hole feels great and looks much more premium than the ugly iPhone notch
3.)Snapdragon 865 is just butter smooth and the refresh rate of 120hz is just something that takes it up the game
4.)Dolby Atmos and the dual speakers are for real and the surround sound gets really loud.
5.)Though OnePlus 6t and OnePlus 8t both are 185grams, I really don't know how did OnePlus manage to make OnePlus 8t so light.
I mean it it's feather weight compared to its size.
6.)Cameras are on point, the colour adjustments are a bit too faded but I guess software updates will make that right.
OnePlus 6t camera got better with software updates.
7.)The warp charge will make you go crazy,
Grab a snack and your battery is good to go.
8.)No heating issues as such.

In the price range that it comes, there is no phone that comes even close as a complete package.
Pixel might offer a better camera but overall it doesn't even come close to OnePlus 8t and Samsung S20 FE has gotten plastic back and Exynos processor, which again is a big time no for a long term OnePlus user like me.

So without doubt, go for this beast.

300,"VERDICT

Display - 9/10
Performance - 10/10
Battery - 10/10
Charging - 10/10
Sound & Haptics - 9/10
Camera - 8/10
Software - 10/10

Overall - 9.5/10

GO FOR THE 12GB variant. For just an extra 3k, you get 4 GB additional RAM & 128 GB additional storage. They have priced the top variant extremely well and offers excellent value over the base variant.

This is my review after 8 days of use (I bought mine on the very 1st day :) of sale - 16th):

I am a long time user of OnePlus devices, so I knew what to expect. Oxygen OS is the best version of Android even today. However, it is unfortunate that OnePlus has started bundling a few unwanted stuff in their software.

Those are as follows:
1. Login with OnePlus account/ Red Cable Club (RCC) - This is present in the Indian devices and cannot be removed. I don't know why they want to force it upon us.
2. OnePlus Cloud - A cloud service which may be useful for some, but forcing it on everyone is unacceptable. A big 'Sign in to Cloud' box shows on your face in the Gallery app and cannot be removed. Very annoying.
3. Zen Mode - deeply integrated with the system. This is in addition to the default Digital Wellbeing app.
4. Preinstalled apps like Netflix (cannot be uninstalled), OnePlus Buds, Amazon, and a handful of others. These can, however be uninstalled.
5. CAMERAS - This is the only disappointment from hardware point of view. Instead of giving the macro and monochrome lenses, they should have given a telephoto lens. That would have been much more useful. I am fine without IP68 & wireless charging.
6. In-display Fingerprint scanner is a bit glitchy. Often fails to register (and therefore read) fingerprint properly. I think this is a software issue and can be fixed with an update.

Pros

1. No Facebook services pre-installed. After backlash in the community for installing that in the Nord devices, they acted wisely by removing it and not including it in the 8T.
2. Display is great with 120Hz AMOLED. I don't have the black crush issue. But I notice the green tint problem when the brightness is very low (around 10% with auto-brightness enabled) and the display seems to struggle a bit. It is random and NOT present all the time. You will notice this only in pitch dark environments. Unless this is a device-specific quality related issue, I am not too bothered because it is hardly noticeable.
3. Charging - The most unique part of this phone. Super fast charging. I usually put it on charge when the battery is around 20% and it fully charges under 40 minutes.
4. Battery life is great. I have consistently got over 6 hours of screen-on-time everyday. I charge around 20%, so if I push it, I know I can get about 8 hours SOT. But it is NOT advisable to let the battery charge drop below 15%.
5. OOS is fluid and super fast. RAM management is great too. With 12GB RAM, I don't have to worry about it. There are a few minor software bugs, and I hope the company would fix them soon. Nothing that would make for a poor user experience though.
6. I don't have any heating issues. The phone gets warm to the touch when doing video calls, and that is normal.
7. Gaming is great and no lags or any issues. I must say I haven't played too much except for testing purposes.
8. Speakers are great with nice haptic feedback. Dolby Atmos is included, but I didn't find any improvement with it. Hopefully they will allow that to be tweaked more in future updates.
9. Call quality and network reception/ connectivity are all great.
10. Face unlock is superfast.

If you are into photography and need best cameras on your phone, this is NOT for you. Even the Samsung Galaxy S20FE has better cameras at a similar price point. Other than that, this is the best phone under 50k if you are okay with no wireless charging/ IP68.

Please note that I am NOT saying that the camera is bad. Just that it is not the best, and I wish they had included a telephoto lens. You can take very good pictures with the 8T and Nightscape is amazing. The pictures produced by the 8T are not photography perfect (when judged on specific parameters), but still great for viewing and especially for sharing on social media.",4.0
301,"Classic Oneplus product as you'd expect from a flagship killer aka non flagship device.

1. Performance and software : Awesome is the least word to describe how fast this phone is. Adding to perform, there is oxygen os11 which has been refined and new features.

2. Display: I had issues with my previous oneplus 7t, but thankfully there is none with this device. It is a gorgeous looking panel.

3 Built quality: Again excellent built quality. But they should have provided more variety of colours like black and blue.

4. Battery and charging: Battery life is very good, it lasts longer than I expected it to be. Charging speed is nuts, take that how ever you want to, it's just super fast.

5 Camera: It's good for the price, but when you look at the competition, pixel and S20FE, they have better cameras. Not saying it's bad just it falls behind the competition in this price segment. It's the only weak part of this phone because the rest all things of this phone are soo good that this camera system makes itself visible as a potential weakness in it. Still though it's a good camera.

Honorable mentions : Dear ONEPLUS, I've been a fan from the first phone you have launched and I've personally used it which is the one plus one and I've used many other oneplus phones after that and there after many of my family members and friends began to buy considering the value you provide for the amount we are paying. But there are certain things which has to be mandatory if you consider any phone a flagship i.e wireless charging and a proper IP rating.

Personally this is a major draw back of the phone considering its competition, the S20FE has both and many people may go for samsung just because of those 2 reasons which adds to the durability of the phone. Hope you hear me out and include those 2 major check points in the coming models.",4.0
302,"Camera is the major weak point of this phone,just like it was for OnePlus 8.It seems as if OnePlus are now taking their customers for granted.Their thought.process seems to be that most customers are happy with a camera that is just above average and they shove these useless macro and depth sensors down our throats instead of a solid telephoto lens like the one on 7t.I purchased this 8t only bcos it had a flat screen and that I would anyways be using a Google camera port for the camera,because the phone excels in every other area except camera.

So if camera is your top priority you would be better served with phones like galaxy s20 fe .

If you are one of those tech enthusiasts who is any way going to use a gcam mod , then you can very well go for this phone and you wouldn't be dissapointed.

My main issue with the camera is the Inconsistent white balance. The primary camera is capable of taking some great shots when it gets it right. OnePlus needs to up their camera image processing game.
Another main issue while clicking pics is the extremely variation in white balance between regular and 2x portrait shots.

For 2x portrait shots the white balance is totally off.",4.0
303,"Awesome phone. Pros everyone are aware of. I will talk about the Cons.
1. Phone heating up quite a lot. Almost every task you perform will heat up the phone.
2. Camera is not up to that level. Went for OnePlus 8t instead of MI 10t for overall package but camera seems a big let down as compared to its competitor.

Other than these 2 major Cons the phone is excellent in performance and call quality.
Gaming in it is amazing and exciting.",4.0
304,"Received on 18th Oct 2020. 1+2, 1+3,1+5,1+6t n now 1+8t. Oxygen OS is too good and never had any reason to switch to any other brands.
Battery back up is good for a day.
Considered Mi10t pro but only good thing about that phone may be that 108mp camera.
Stuck to 1+ mainly coz of the almost stock android experience.
Built quality is good, stereo speakers now sound excellent, volume is adequate.
Always on display is a boon.
Camera quality is good for daily photography n all. If I need dslr quality photos, I would use a Dslr.
Charging is lighting fast with new 65w charger.
This is definitely not a flagship model but it was a good phone to upgrade from 6T.
Sold off my back up iPhone 6S as exchange for 1+8t 😆. If any queries, drop me a message. Will update after further usage.",4.0

306,"I have brought 8t lunar silver color and below is the my first impression.
Pros -
1) It feels very premium and light in weight
2) UI is super fast and smooth
3) Decent camear

Cons -
1) It is observed phone heats up to some extent near camera module in normal uses as well
2) It takes some time to load images in gallery or load icons once phone boots up. Seems to be storage or software issue.
3) Battery gets drain very fast even though with normal uses. Yesterday I hardly able to get backup of 10 hrs

Battery is the main concern to worry however I will be checking this for one more day and then decide to keep it or return",4.0
307,"Being used to OnePlus family of devices right from the One to Five to now 8T, it's been a journey of change, bigger screens, fast to ultra fast charging, however the camera could've been better!
+120Hz is slick, you may not want to go back to 60Hz
+Warp charge 65 is blazing fast, and the bottom doesn't heat up as well
+Display is nice and pleasing
+Droid 11 out of the box, however Oxygen OS has the biggest change by deviating from stock Android to customisations (some would like it while some wouldn't)
+Buttery smooth OS, works like a charm
-Some customisations are really good use
-battery lasts for a day and more based on usage, but with the warp charge, you never run out of power
+Cooling system is too good, you never feel too much heat even after long hours of use or gaming
+Always on is a nice feature and I love the Canvas

-Camera is good but nothing evolutionary, OP needs to work in this areas on hardware rather than always tweaking the algorithms
-Some apps are not customized to 120Hz refresh and may act weird
-OS design seems to be heavily influenced from Samsung, OP can do better on their own and do good
-Elegant design nevertheless, nothing groundbreaking
-Might feel a tad heavy for some

Lastly,
Aquamarine green looks lovely in the hand, worth picking it up over the Silver

308,"Reviewing it after 2 weeks of use:

Pros:

1. Charging speed - Outstanding (20-100% in ~30 minutes)
2. Display and touch - Excellent (120Hz is frigging awesome!)
3. The hardware in general is really good
4. Fingerprint Scanner - Fast as hell
5. No green tint issues on display
6. Phone barely heats while charging
7. Phone barely heats while gaming
8. Even the lowest brightness shows excellent blacks.

Cons:

1. Average camera - Photos in good light are excellent, but photos taken at lowlight/using nightscape sucks. However, if you use Pro mode (or Gcam), the quality is excellent. That shows that the camera lenses are fine, it's the stock camera software that's bad.

2. Poor battery life on dark mode - If you use dark theme, your phone almost always gonna be at 120Hz, resulting in below average battery life. It doesn't dynamically switch the refresh rate on dark mode. However, if you use light theme for the system, the battery is good. This is a clear software issue. Samsung S20 FE with similar specs gets 9hours SOT at 120Hz. We get barely 5.5 hours on dark mode. That's bad. This is due to the dynamic refresh rate switching not working on dark mode.

PS: Got 2 updates in the 2 weeks that I started using my phone, which were supposed to fix power optimization and camera quality. No noticeable difference came.

Verdict: Good phone with a great hardware and poor software.
If you are good at rooting and custom roms flashing, wait for custom roms to come and use those. In the meantime, you can root and flash custom kernels. That actually improved my SOT. Even though OxygenOS is clean looking, it's just the look. The performance is bad.",4.0
309,"A great phone at this price. The back main camera pictures are nice but they should improve the front camera specially provide night mode. Battery life is good and last throughout the day. It gets a little warm sometimes, note I don't play heavy games much and there is a hollow feeling at the back of the phone when speakers are on. But overall I'm happy with my decision and the performance of the phone is undoubtedly great.",4.0
310,"This is my first experience with one plus which is not good at all. Initially whhen the phone was delivered i was prtty kuch excited but as I strt to install stuff n set up my google ac n all the phone strtd to heat up. I put it on charge it heated up prtty bad. Okay so does any new phone gts heated up on the 1st day itself? I was very disappointed . I contacted Amazon customers service thy sent a tchnician at my plce , he said the phone doesn't have any issue . I didn't have any other choice left then to use it.
I would rate my experience till now- Battery - 3.5/5 ( battry backup is not good at all)
Camera- 4.5/5
Speed- 4/5
Sound -4.5/5
Screen qualify -4/5

The only issue is that it heats up very fast n vry bad. While playin not so heavy games it heats up. While charging it heats up prtty bad.

Overall i would say i expxtd much more at this price from one plus. Its would make an awesome phne if there was no heating issues.",4.0
311,"I have purchased this phone with 12gb Ram & 256gb storage, it's also available with 8gb varient. Oneplus T version phone are always good. Oneplus 8 or 8pro has some display and heating issue but this is good

1. Phone charging is very very fast. Charge in 30-40min to 100%
2. Decent camera
3. It comes with phone cover and temperad glass
4. This phone looks like premium quality.
5. Snapdragon 865 processor 😍

Bad part
1. I feel this phone little hot during transferring the phone date from old phone to this one. But it's not all the time. Now it's working well.
2. Camera could have been little better. Oneplus need to workon it. Samsung S20 FE has better camera.

If someone do not want to buy this phone then I will suggest them.
Samsung S20 FE or Mi10T Pro
These set are with same range and almost same configuration.

I did't not go with Samsung S20FE beacuse it has shitty processor which is octa-core Samsung Exynos 990.",4.0
312,"I am a loyal Oneplus user and i upgraded from One plus 6t to OP8T.
Build: Absolutely great build quality. Build quality is always great on the one plus devices. Even though it has a massive screen, it still feels okay to hold it in one hand. Beware that since both sides are glass, it is slippery. So it is advisable to use a case
Software & UI: Oxygen OS has been close to stock android since so long but with the new OS which comes out of the box with OP8T, there has been a shift in that. It is now more customized, which depending on your tastes, you may or may not like. I liked it. Loved the dark theme. The best thing is the lock screen customization which shows the number of unlocks.
Camera: The chink in the armor of OP8T is the camera. Its actually worse than the OP6T i was using. The sensors are quite old and i just dont get the monochrome camera which take very bad photos. Dont get me wrong. Compared to a normal midrange phone, it is still very good. It performs like a dream in natural light conditions but really struggles in the low light. The one feature i really liked was the selfie portrait video mode.
Battery: Superb battery life. I am a fairly heavy user and till now i end the day with >55% battery. The charging speed is also superb. It takes hardly 25 mins to go from 15% to 95%. Although i wish there was an option of slow charging.

Bottom Line: One plus 8T is a solid all round phone with mediocre cameras. If you are a photography buff, look at Samsung S20 FE. But if you want a phone which will last you for years and keep up the great performance, you can look at OP8T.",4.0
313,"I got this new phone Oneplus 8T just a week back with exchange in sale with discount and let me tell u it's worth every penny if u r looking for a premium phone in this price range...
I have 12gb variant aquamarine..in hand it feels so good that apple 12 might shy a bit here...i did a comparison of it with apple 12 and trust me except camera and speed(which normaly everyone doesnt even care about) this can give a tough competition to apple 12. Battery runs more than 24 hrs a day and charges in just 40 mins with warp charging wired set. Oxygen OS is good afterall it is termed as world best android os...prior to this i had k20 pro...same chipset same features but whats different here is a bit improved screen and premium feel...refresh rate of 120 hz feels amazing..so smooth...beats apple here...amoled dispaly is awesome...Back sony imx camera is good not as good as Oneplus 8 pro but it is not at all bad. The only thing which i would have wanted to improve is battery...though it goes for 1 day without any issues but it heats up a bit with wifi and heavy gaming and also starts losing charge fast. Thats the only issue i see in this one but i saw couple of videos comparing oneplus 8t to other one plus devices and it seems it has the highest runtime compared to others...but heating is an issue for sure",4.0
314,"I rarely write reviews but this time I thought I need to share my experience, I was little disappointed to see how Indian audience get influenced by tech reviewers (especially the USA one). They are comparing a device which is launched $100 more to an Indian pricing so there experience will be totally different considering the price point.

In India it is for almost $540 dollars. In this price range I don't think we will get any better value. Very good phone with an above average camera, if you're clicking for social media then in 95% of the cases all the high-end camera looks same. Software experience is surreal; Almost similar like pixel.

Pixel 5 and 4A 5G is not available in India plus Google mobile strategy sucks in India

Samsung FE is 130 dollars more than 8T. I was using S9 and believe me after 7-8 months Samsung phones start lagging. They force you to use their crappy
Samsung play store. Samsung software is really pain some time.

iPhone 12 - Damm expensive in an Indian market, Price difference from an International pricing is insane.

Apparently Yes, They are doing to much marketing with their camera system. 2 lenses are crap but overall its a very capable Cam plus if we get the GCAM for 8T. BOOM.
Under 550$ this is the best value a consumer can get in an Indian market.

I am using this device for the last 6 days - No heating issues (I didn't use for gaming purpose), No blue or red tint on screen, Sound quality is good but it's just you feel little vibration at back when u play songs at max volume - I reckon its common in stereo speakers because i felt the same in other devices also.

P.S: Not a 1+ fan, never used their devices as my regular daily drivers (previously I was using Galaxy S8/S9 and believe me it feels 3X faster to those phones) but this is the company which is really hearing their customer (especially in India) Cheers!",4.0
315,"Writing this review after a week of rigorous use. The device is light and evenly balanced. The product touch response @240Hz is buttery smooth! Be assursed that you will find all other smartphones less responsive than this. So you just don't have the option to revert. The processor SD865 is one of the fastest in the market and all the setup installations will hardly be felt. Furthermore, unlike other processors, this processor doesn't heat the phone much and also the heat vapour chamber inside the phone ensures the temperature remains at the optimum level. The calling and network quality which majority reviewers don't mention about are also glitch free. The very first OTA update was downloaded within few seconds, such is the WiFi 6 network connectivity coupled with ultrafast UFS 3.1 data storage technology. The display refresh rate @120Hz simply makes the viewing content lag free and flawless. The display brightness of upto 1100 nits will permit you to operate your phone even in the mid of summer daylight, such is its fantastic brightness. Ambient light is also decent but not perfectly synchronized with the light sensor. Hence generally less brighter than the surrounding light. Earpic loudness is pretty good. Even a nearby person can hear the call. Stereo sound loudness is great too but with some compromise in quality as the sound appears to be coming from light plastic frame speakers and not those from box speakers. The phone at the peak volume also starts to vibrate a lot, giving somewhat an inferior feel. Phone OS is minimalistic yet pretty fulfilling. Enthusiasts may have additional features by installing 3rd party apps. The UI customisation is also pretty good! This will make sure that you do not get bored with the same personalised display content. The 65W warp charging is simply superb while setting a benchmark which all other smartphone brands have to match with, else the customer's changed habit will not allow them to revert to their previous brand at any cost. Hopefully this ultra fast charging doesn't degrade the 4500mAh battery at a faster pace which already gives around one day of normal usage. The side buttons are also pretty decent and require only an optimum gentle push for their functioning. But the camera setup used in this phone is not so impressive as the other setups used. Oneplus' touting of dual LED beside the cameras is actually misleading in the sense as the optical glasses of the LED and the colour temperature sensor looks almost similar. So effectively there is only one hole section allotement for LED and not two. But on closer look one may actually find that in this section there are two small LEDs, which unfortunately is not so bright to even match with the normal single LED of many smartphones. So selling the phone by showcasing the feature of dual LED setup simply shows the company's product selling-oriented intent. The macro and monochrome sensors used are also more of a gimmick to make the phone have quad camera setup. Majority of the time macro camera just doesn't focus properly. So it becomes easy to shoot with the primary camera. But the primary camera too has focusing issues at the nearby object but not so much as that of macro camera. This focusing problem can be ignored if one uses the manual focusing in pro mode at the expense of some time. The colours are also lost or hued greater due to some non perfect processing and hence true images are not produced especially in the macro camera. Switching from 12MP to 48MP also doesn't make even a slight difference in the image quality except increasing the file size dramatically. Usage of two years old Sony IMX586 sensor in primary camera just turns off many enthusiasts who keep on purchasing newer and more expensive phones to just improve the camera quality by a mere fraction percent. Brands like Apple using a decade old hardware technology in some of their's hardware configuration are yet able to outsell major brands due to their pretty decent camera. The Oneplus 8T's obsolete camera setup and it's associated focusing issue was felt so disappointingly on the first hands on experience after using years of brilliant Samsung's camera that I even decided to return the phone altogether and again go back to Samsung's newly released S20 FE by ignoring its ever heating Exynos processor. But after tweaking with pro mode and observing that the manual focus can produce acceptable pictures, I thought that may be with OTA update the focusing issue and colour dynamic range will be improved and thereafter Oneplus 8T could be called as a true ""Flagship Killer"" of 2020. Till then this ""Ultra stops at something!""",4.0
316,"Pros:-

1. Beautiful, flat, smooth display;
2. Clean and light software, Netflix being the only third part bloatware that can't be installed;
3. Flagship chipset + 3.1 storage + light software guarantees seamless performance;
4. Insanely fast charging;
5. Comes with Android 11 out of the box, which is a pro considering the pathetic state of the android update situation;
6. Comes with a screen protector pre applied and a transparent TPU case included in the box;
7. Build is premium and seems to be sturdy.

Cons:-
1. Really bad cameras considering the price. A useless macro camera and a ""monochrome"" camera that does literally nothing. Then there's a flash-looking sensor that also plays no apparent role ever. The photos are worse than what I get from my 5-year-old S7 edge;
2. Battery life is average. Sometimes discharges really quickly;
3. The battery saver mode doesn't seem to save much battery;
4.No headphone jack.

Overall a very good product but the poor camera performance ruins the experience to a big extent for me.

I shall update this review as I continue to use this phone.",4.0
317,"Excellent 👌...
I have been using oneplus brand since it's x model was launched 2015. Used it for 2.5 yrs without any issue. Here I became a fond of OnePlus..Than after I bought oneplus 5t in 2017. 5T : I would say about the 5T was damn good man...still in efficient performance i.e. stable battery with real 6gb ram speed though was being even rough used for the last 4yrs. Than I wish to change the phone just because of the shake of expanses on gadgets since I haven't spend money with phone since last 4yrs 😜😜. I ordered 8pro with 12gb ram. Unfortunately I returned that piece since I got update about upcoming launch of 8T.
8T... It's an amazing phone.. I accept that battery little weak with 120ghz display but still you have option to use phone most of the time on 60ghz. 120 to be used once if it is required i.e. watch movie. Games etc.",4.0
318,"To be honest OnePlus 8T is a awesome mobile with latest Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system. However, couple of cons which i have noticed is; 1) Battery: Need to charge twice a day- all credit to Warp Charge 65 power adapter which is really a boon while you need to charge twice a day.

2) I am not sure if anyone has noticed, Mobile Bank applications like Canara bank and Yono (SBI) applications won't open. (Checked with other OnePlus 8T mate and same is the case)

3) Camera is other drawback which i hardly use, so people who are not camera freak can ignore.

Apart from the above everything is super cool, people can go for it & stay relaxed on the latest updates until next 5 years with 5G mobile.

Thanks to Amazon for in time delivery.",4.0
319,"My experience:

Fingerprint reader- good

Camera quality- good (not very impressive but in terms of OnePlus cameras over a past series of phones , it's getting better ""my thought"") and also there is somany features in camera section which can consume your time with phone.

Processor- impressive speed with new
2.86 GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Octa-core Processor + Adreno 650 GPU ,Oxygen OS based on Android 11 Operating system.

Display- my previous phone was poco F1 so my comparison comes with a limited sight. So, very smooth........120 Hz gives us a smooth experience.

Weight- light weight

Design- as always classy design from OnePlus.

Battery- 4500 mah battery is not bad while watching videos even in 120 hz it gives us more time for continuous watch. But, I noticed something when I play games. I played a lot of games. I spend more time with ' pubg ' than other games. So when I started playing pubg in my fully charged OnePlus 8T , condition was good. Battery is steady and it takes time to get drain. But after continuous use, heating problem arises and battery drains fast ( after 30 - 50 minutes of usage ).

Gaming- other than battery drainage gaming was awesome.

Warp Charger- very fast I mean realy realy fast.

Note :
There is no 3.5 mm audio jack. So you should wait again for the arrival of audio jack converter unless you already have c type headset .

My overall experience was nice with OnePlus 8T but battery is still a problem as a gamer hope they will fix this issue with upcoming series........",4.0
320,"Reviewing after 3months of rigorous usage.
Being a hard-core samsung user for almost a decade, it was a difficult decision to switch to Oneplus.
Well, Samsung is no doubt the best (baap) among most tier of smart phone. But there were some sections in which Samsung was lagging behind, that is why I made the switch to Oneplus.
Previously, I was using Samsung galaxy S8. And was working fine even after 4 years.

Reason for the switch:
Pros:
Dont know why samsung fails to provide Snapdragon processor for the Indian market. The Exynos processor of Samsung is very problematic. Obviously it cannot be compared to SD, SD is way ahead in many factors naming few, RAW power, battery consumption, (heating) heats to max temperature (40C - 41C) only when you are trying to suck the life out of the device then cooling down to normal level in a minimum span of time. I must say OnePlus did a great job here with the heating issue, handled like a boss. Samsung fails like a fool here.
I wanted to use the raw power of my mobile phone without any lag or other.

65W charging, that's crazy fast man!! You won't believe it takes only 30 to 35mins to charge a 4500mah battery. Then it last minimum for a day after a normal usage.

120hz 😍. I wish they had given 120HZ + curved but it is okay, I was tired of the curved screen because of the way you need to hold the device to avoid miss inputs.

Dual throwing speaker 🔊. One of the best speakers I have had listened to. It gives a sort of haptic feel from the back of the device if you are watching some video in landscape while holding the device. Nice experience.

On-screen fingerprint reader > physical fingerprint reader.

The three way switch for putting your device to silent-vibrate-general is the cherry on the top.

Cons:
Well you cannot expect a total upgrade as there are some drawbacks in Oneplus (when compared to Samsung).
There are some technical advantage in using a Samsung mobile which cannot be beaten by any other.

The Samsung camera! Even if my new 8T has a 48MP Sony sensor camera, it cannot beat Samsung S8's 4year old camera. The single 12 dual megapixel camera does all the job for which OP need 4 camera units, except the ultra wide camera on OP(good to have).
You can create a wide range of good photos with that single 12mp camera. It does take awesome canvas shot, good portrait shots (with the selective focus option), awesome macro shot (with the food shot option).
Though OP 8T's back camera is not so bad, it is just not up to the mark. I would say it is decent.
The front camera is worthless on the OP 8T. The quality is very bad. The position of the punchhole camera makes you look like a squint. You will need some time to learn how not to look like a squint on your selfies, if you are not a pro in taking selfies like me. You have to look at a specific spot on the screen then only your selfies will look like proper portraits.

Well most people say samsung provide so much bloatware, I was also one among such people, that is true, it eats around 10 to 14gb. But you will understand how useful those bloatware were, once you start using your new non-samsung device. It used to give so much accessibility over your device if you knew how to use those bloatware. Those were not bloatwares at all I would say.

Screen quality, on OP 8T it was 408~ dpi but on S8 you don't need any number to define the quality, one glance on the SAmoled screen and you would know S8 has a better screen(570dpi). That is why I guess Samsung is considered as one of The best screen manufacturer for mobile devices.

OP doesn't feels like a flagship on the hand nor to the eyes. Because it fails to add that something (x factor) to the cosmetic value of the device. It look like a normal mobile.

Overall I am happy with the device as I got all the features that I expected from it. I would rate it 4 out 5 stars as it could have been better.",4.0
321,"One of the finest Oneplus devices. The Oneplus 8T brings all the power packed features that someone would expect from 'Flagship'. The most impacting thing i noticed is the speed which Oneplus always talks about. It's impressive, Oxygen OS is indeed the fastest android skin present in the market right now. Though needs few improvements in Oxygen OS 11 as i can notice some minor bugs here n there. Camera is decent and does a good job in almost all kind of lighting conditions. Battery life is awsome, what do u need more when u have got Snapdragon 865 backing up under the hood. The raw performance while gaming PUBG(now BGMI)at Ultra HD. No frame drops or such kind of heating issues. Wrap Charge 65 is toooo much fast. Cellular call Quality and reception is excellent, No issues found from my side as i tested it via Jio and as well as VoWiFi all works flawlessly. Selfie camera is a weak point though I can live with the quality it has on offer so no complains. So summing it up, Go for it, u won't regret. As far as i have researched and tested, One of the fewest Recent Oneplus device which does great work and doesn't disappoints. GO FOR IT ❤️🎇🥳

One drawback, although not a show stopper is the camera, don't get me wrong, the cameras are really good, but for this price Oneplus should have gone for better cameras.

Update:
=======
So many updates in just a month of use, seems oneplus in a bid to luanch OOS 11 , did not test stability with the phone. Still, despite the frequent updates, the phone is working smoothly for me. One major issue that I have found is the TWS compatibility with some devices, mostly a software bug, as it works with other OnePlus devices of similar generation. The support is very slow and don't seem to keen on solving the issue. Cynic in me thinks its a wierd way of promoting thier wireless buds.",4.0

- a good premium build quality ✓
- looks premium ✓
- a good screen with high refresh rate ✓
- a good battery ✓
- fast charging ✓
- a good brand name ✓
- good software update and optimization ✓
- finally a good camera --- this is where I want to give a little more detail.
Now the camera is no doubt very good and capture some really good images be it day light or Nightscape mode. Love the ois for video recording. The focussing ability is awesome. The 5mp macro lens is okayish and not a great. Capture kind of good image but definitely lacks details. The wide angle also looks good but not as good as the primary sensor.
The software optimization for the camera looks very good to me. The image looks good after processing which is like super fast and doesn't seem like it is being processed (eg in pixel phones it takes like 2 second before you can take next photos).
The front camera is also good and images turn out to be super good after processing. HDR works well with the cameras.
Overall the camera is good enough to take awesome shots but again is not the best in category. But it is good enough to make it a complete package.
Now who is this phone for?
I would recommend anyone who if buys a phone and uses it for next 2-3 years if you are looking for a new phone you can definitely buy this. If someone who has recently bought a premium category phone in like last 1 year I don't think you are getting anything new here with this phone and should wait a little for new phones to come.
The battery life on the phone is very good and charging is superfast.
I have added a few shots of primary, Nightscape, macro shots",4.0
331,"Pros:
- 120Hz Supersmooth display
- Flat display is a welcoming change
- Lunar Silver looks very elegant and professional
- Performance is very great
- Camera is good
- Battery charging speed is insane

Cons:
- Purplish tinting when set on minimum brightness only appears while scrolling
- Camera could be better they are using same old sensors which they have used on past generation of one plus devices
- 10X zoom is bad. Seems like oil painting at that range
- Phone gets hot while charging usually.
- Battery backup could be better but charging speed compensate for that",4.0
332,"Genuine Review=

Phone is good if we talk about the looks and feel, performance is also very fine. Sometime it overheats while playing Pubg, Yes it's true it heats sometime.
Moving from iPhone 8 to OnePlus 8t honestly speaking I didn't feel that I am upgrading myself except camera.
Having heard too much about the OnePlus brand and specially 8T, it didn't impressed me.
If you are planning to buy if you have iOS device, I would suggest do not try this option. But if you are upgrading your device from Android to Android, than it's huge difference you will feel.
Thanks for reading",4.0
333,"Got the 12gb variant at 41.5k after all discounts.
Switched from Note10plus to Op8T and I vould literally feel the difference in speed and performance right from day1 (although Samsung's Exynos isn't nowhere comparable to Snapdragon)
120hz display is a bang for the buck you pay.
My only disappointment is that there wasn't much improvement interms of camera from Oneplus 6 to 8T.

65W fast charge is real quick but the battery drains quick too.",4.0
334,"Here is my review.

Battery Charge and life - Awesome.
Display Quality - Very good, caught upto Samsung S10 display.
Camera -
Let down as of now.
48MP camera is too good.
Portriat pics color contrast is not good.
Monochrom leans are really good
Macro camera Focus is really bad.
Over all focus of camera is bad.
Front camera is just Ok and serves the purpose.
I hope OnePlus will address Camera drawbacks in upcoming updates.

Oxygen OS - Too good as usual.

You can go for this phone without hesitation. But you got to be patient about camera.",4.0
335,"I have been using OnePlus since OnePlus 7. It is indeed a company who tries to do the things differently. Journey from one plus one to 8 has been great but over last couple of years they have reached a stagnation. No major breakthrough during last couple of years. Best part is their software support which is also getting slow day by day.
One plus 8T is a regular bphone if you compare with current competition. Medicore Camera and battery are major letbacks. Display is ok but not as fantastic as Samsung. Samsung has nailed the display market from years. Performance is good as OnePlus always uses latest processors. Could have been better if thay would have used 865+ alongside DDR5 Ram and Quad HD display. OnePlus 7 and 7T pro display is much better than 8T.

OnePlus has to change there strategy if they want to survive in current competition. They should not forget what happened to Nokia and Motorola despite best hardwares. Price strategy also needs recalibration. I feel price of 8T is almost 5K more than what is being offered. Still they can consider themselves in premium leagues of Samsung and Apple but in the lower side.",4.0
336,"I feel the battery life is a bit low for me. Although I use it at 120Hz. But if not using it to its maximum limit then what is the point of buying such kind of phone. Btw the phone is damn fast and since last one month have never found a single glitch or any kind of issues. I expected it to have SD 865+ but 865 is just fine. I feel the heating problem of OnePlus is getting solved but it needs to be even more cooler. Camera is not quite upto the mark.
So if you can ignore the camera and battery I think it's the best phone to buy at this price range.",4.0

338,"I have been using OnePlus products since some years and this has to be fantastic just like any other with the main reason of my purchase being the 'Oxygen OS'. The fingerprint reader had some issues while setting up the fingerprint but thankfully OnePlus has updated it in software update. Build, design and looks is top notch, especially with the Aquamarine Green colour (I have seen both colours). Battery life is very good with 60 hz refresh rate in display + the warp charge is very powerful.

Apart from the fingerprint issue I mentioned, there are 2-3 things more like the Accessibility Menu Shortcut which is very handy & useful gets automatically disabled.

The OTG cable of OnePlus I have is not being supported in this.

340,"Review after 24 hrs

Pro -
Best phone.
Runs anything you give too smooooothly. Tried COD , Asphalt 9. 🔥
Oxygen OS 11 and whole interface is easy and fast.
Best display with Amoled & 120Hz refresh rate while surfing or gaming. No display issue as observed on 8 & 8 Pro.
Good battery backup,could last one day for moderate usage.
Charging speed 0-100 in 39-45mins.
Aquamarine green do looks more amazing in actual. Phone looks good & premium.

Cons -
One star less for Camera quality. For this price we expect a better camera.
IP rating and Wireless charging was too expected at this price range.

Noticed a little bit heat at start while loading all apps and setting. But later no heat was observed while using, gaming or charging.

Don't think much just buy it if you have it in your mind.
Hope it was helpful.
Thanks for listening.",4.0
341,"Bought this as a replacement for my 5T which served me faithfully for 3 years.
So new one should be more than its predecessor. Isn't it? Let's see.
First positives:
1. Super fast charging. Takes 40 min to charge full.
2. Battery life. With 60 Hz it's a good two days with screen time of 8 hours. With 120hz depleats faster.
3. Beautiful back.
4. Good screen size
5. Android 11 out of the box
6. Cosmetic upgrades on display
7. Wifi calling. Needed for me as at home I don't get mobile signal.
8. Nice amoled display

Now why it is not a great upgrade from 5T
1. No notification light
2. Heavier
3. Back flimsy and vibrates while playing music or on call
4. 120 Hz overkill for non gamers.
5. Without the warp charger takes eons to charge.

Suggestion
One plus should have a plain model with good battery targetted at utility sector.

5T served me fine and still is great. Not once hung. Not confident on 8T on first looks.

At 16k redmi note 9 pro has most of the positives I mentioned and a larger screen. I do have that and its value for money",4.0
342,"Went from cancelling NORD , and switching to 8T, both 12/256 respectively.

I must say , it was perfect decision just in time.

Very happy with the performance of the phone .(Snapdragon 865 chipset with 5G ready does justice )
Call quality , mobile data speed , speakers output , one handed feel and grip of phone , haptic feedback , in display fingerprint reader, everything is just perfect.

Few cons I felt.

Camera quality is just average , battery doesn't seem to be 4500 mah , lasts just 5 hrs of moderate usage ( might be because I use this in 120ghz refresh rate & always on display ).
Nevertheless 65w superfast warp charge does not make me feel out of juice.

The only thing I felt we must had , refresh rate option of 90ghz expect 60ghz , at 60ghz scrolling felt quite slow and laggy. If there would be 90 ghz option , we can save more battery and SOT time shall increase more.

One thing I tried out of big risk , I tried to do a water resistant test , although it is not IP CERTIFIED, but I went for it as I saw many videos of the same on Youtube. I submerged in water for 20 mins , and out of big surprise 8T passed this test , no water inside Sim tray , no camera malfunctioning , no ghost touches .
everything's Running PERFECT !

ONE PLUS DOESNT WANT TO SPEND MORE ON OFFICIAL IP RATING , CERTAINLY , IP RATING COMPANY WILL CHARGE THEIR HEFTY FEE AND AT LAST IT GETS BURDENED ON END CUSTOMER , SO OP DOES SMART WORK HERE , THEY DOESNT OFFICALY ANNOUNCE WATER RESISTANT BUT THEY DO HAVE SAME WATER RESISTANCE LEVELS AS IP67/68.
MANY TEARDOWN VIDEOS ARE AVAILABLE ON YOUTUBE WHERE WE CAN SEE , NEW GENERATION OP PHONES ARE BUILT LIKE THAT THEY CAN SURVIVE MAXIMUM WATER TESTS.",4.0
343,"Reviewing the product after 10 days.

1. Display is good and vibrant. Even in bright daylight condition the viewing angles of the product is good.

2. The product is good in terms of audio output. It has the best stereo speakers in the market. Little disappointed 😞 OnePlus has not bundled 3.5 mm to type c connector along with the box. One has to seperately purchase the cable to enjoy audio effects through wired headset. Typical TPU case Is provided in the box and screen guard pre-applied.

3. Camera quality is superb. PFA. It has good details. Nightscape shots are good but not good as pixel 4a.

4. Battery life is average. I can't see much increase in battery life when I changed my screen refresh rate from 120 hz to 60 hz .

5. Fingerprint location is good and 99% of the time it works.

6. Don't have any problems regarding basic phone functions like call quality , sign issue. But often I noticed few apps are popping message as no network connection but I can see YouTube is running perfectly at that time.

7. Overall I can say it's a good product for audiophile and students ( considering the digital well-being things mentioned in phone )

8. Pricing could have been under 40k.",4.0
344,"I am a moderate mobile phone user with moderate gaming requirements.
My foremost reason for buying this phone was the metallic body which, in my opinion, helps in durability of the device.
No problem of black bar or any screen colour distortion as mentioned in some other reviews.

Pros: Metallic body so device is durable. Beautiful display. Lovely screen display colours and screen quality. Great processor speed. Fast charging with warp charger. The phone comes with screen guard and mobile cover in the box along with the charger. Camera quality is great. Videos are very clear too. The benefit of super stable mode for outdoor videos is great.
12GB ram and 256 GB memory are enough to run all games smoothly. Refresh rate can be optimised between 120 and 60 Hz as per need.

Cons: Finger print reader is average. Low light photos could have been improvised. Battery back up is a little disappointing. Battery drains quite fast.

Overall a great device. Would recommend it to anyone who is looking in this price segment.",4.0

3. Form factor is also good...operatable with one hand at ease..and a good hand feel which is worth paying this much amount.
4. Performance..I don't need to say anything..one plus is known for it and has set benchmarks..and they have done with this also
5. Camera..it is disappointing...do not feel at all flagship....a bit over average I would say...65/100 for camera only.

350,"Review (12GB):
This phone has very good performance. I ordered Lunar silver but received Aquamarine green. I dont' want to spend more time on this, so kept it.

Pros:
=> Great performance/speed for SD 865 processor
=> Battery life is fine
=> Priced ok considering highend features the phone provides, but misses a wahh feeling considering it a high end phone.
=> Gesture control, Finger print scanner is nice
=> Good cover provided with the phone, that really helps

Cons:
=> Experienced high heating when using the InShare app for sharing media.
=> Heating while charging the phone. May be because of fast charge effect, OnePlus should look into this. After 100% charge, it automatically get cooled. (Update: I received an oxygen OS 11.x.x update on Nov 2, and it has the fixes for heating issues, heating is reduced).

As others are complaining there is
=> No display tint issues
=> No heating issues while using the phone, gaming etc. But noticed while charging
=> No charging issues, within 10-15 mins 60-70% charging

Rear Camera is good. Getting good pics in portrait mode. But 16 MP front cam does a bad job when took pics from a distance in timer mode. Getting unclear pics. Selfies coming good. But camera lacks features considering 46k price.

No telephoto, no zoom. Nowadays its NOT a flagship killer, its a business for OnePlus.

Edited after 6 months of usage. Reduced the rating.",3.0

Every now and then you will get errors. Many useful functions which was there on older oneplus device is removed from this device. Stereo speaker is not upto the mark. Storage related issue is there due to which we cannot install certain apps even though the phone has 200 gb storage available.

On the contrary, I am unable to publish anything on OnePlus community as the phone gets hanged while publishing post. Also I can't update OnePlus Gallery app in play Store as all the time it says there is some problem in update.

Features like variety of navigation gestures, sms category byfurcation are much more better in OnePlus 7 than this phone. Hopefully OnePlus restores these features in OTA updates soon..

Editing my review after OTA update: Finally able to install OnePlus Gallery app, MAadhar app and banking apps. Thank God it's fixed. Still, camera quality is not upto the mark. If you are a sound lover and crazy about sound quality, you can go for it.

Can't use stock android experience. Where the hell is oxygen OS, its very poor. My older vivo nex was far better in terms of software and UI.

Call recording function not available, I can't understand simply 10k phones now a days have it.

Pros:
1. Good display with 120 Hz sceeen. Simply stunning.
2. Super fast processor and OS. Though Android 11 has some glitches, I'm sure OP will fix them soon.
3. Aesthetically designed well, weight distribution is uniform & handling the phone is way easier thanks to the flat screen.
4. Load speaker is good though the bottom speaker is loader making the steteo experience little awkward at times. But never mind, they're good.
5. The haptic feedback of the vibration motar is good and feels premium
6. Build quality is top notch. The camera bump looks way better in reality than in the pictures

Cons
1. Oh god, what a horrible camera. It's pathetic. I previously used OP6 and felt even that 3 year old phone does a similar job at clicking below par pictures.
2. Why make a glass phone if you don't want to include wireless charging. Specially in 2020, at 46k? Its like spending money on an expensive suit and not buy shoes but wear flip flops! Huh

Conclusion: it's a decent phone but I feel OP got it all wrong with the pricing and features of their 3 phones. The Nord, regular and the pro series. The OP Pro at almost 14k more expensive than the regular isn't worth it for what it offers. But again, is the One plus regular worth over the nord at almost 20k premium? 765G processor is just as good is what I've heard. If you can wait, please don't buy 8T or 8 Pro. Wait for 9.

374,"Bought on 23.10.2020 and review as on 26.10.2020

🔸Battery life could've been slightly more better but overall I am happy with it.
🔸Camera quality seems little dull in low lighting conditions and even in nightsacpe mode I am not completely satisfied as it (OnePlus) claims (Not checked yet in normal lighting conditions, so I'll update later for that too). Not found any difference in 48MP mode and 12MP mode in normal camera.
🔸Device gets warm sometimes even in normal usage and that makes me feel scary to install Asphalt, PUBG, COD or any other heavy games (Will update later when I try them on this)
🔸Other than these things everything is awesome or you can say it's beast of Android. Everything is lighting fast and seamless. I have been using it for now more than 3 days and so far I found 0% lag. Performance is quite awesome.
🔸RAM management is superb. Last time I remembered there was more than 60 apps running in the background and every app I opened started exactly where I left them, so that's great I think.
🔸Storage and file transfering is superfast too.
🔸Sound quality is amazing, feels so real and crispy. Dolby Atmos quality is up to the game.
🔸UI is great, as I love stock android so OOS 11 integration with it quite amazing.

Bought on 23.10.2020 and review as on 27.10.2020

In addition to my above review I want to add few more points regarding issues I've faced after the 4th day of use:-

🔸I don't know it's the new Android 11 or OOS 11 but I found a glitch in the playstore, I tried more than 7 times to install Asphalt 9 on my device but everytime at 99% it stopped downloading and then there a error dialogue box pop up saying it can't be install. I changed my WiFi, cleared cache of the playstore but nothing happened in my favour at the end I rebooted my device and then I tried once again and it works this time. And it happened only with more than 1 GB data apps or games less than that playstore working perfectly. I am not sure whether I'll face this problem again in future or not but it costs me too much data for sure lol.
🔸In Discord when I try to edit any message it doesn't show any edit but at then end of that message there is word ""edited"" written but not any editing showing, so I've to restart the app again & again to see the edited message. It's really annoying. And in other apps too if I give command for something it doesn't appear until I restarts the app again. I don't why it keeps happening.
🔸In YouTube colour and quality is really bad. All colors looks very dull in any quality. I thought AMOLED Display shows you colors very accurately. More saturated, more vibrant etc but I am completely disappointed with this. On this device I suggest you to paly videos on 720p or 1080p quality for some better view otherwise your eyes will start to pain after few minutes of watch. And I noticed this in other videos playing apps too.
🔸Heating issue is getting bigger day by day. Without back cover I don't think I can hold this device for too long in my hands. It gets little warm while charging now too.
🔸I never thought I was gonna review about it but I don't think sometimes it's a Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor device cuz games keep crashing in the middle of playing and sometimes when I play some ads for extra rewards. Sometimes games lags too. I found better performance in 730G devices. But this might be another software issue too. I can't say about it. Hope OnePlus fix these issues soon otherwise I've to replace it. I have two more days left to use and check this device before replacement windows closes. I hope you guys aren't facing these issues.",3.0
375,"So much Disappointed with this model OP8T.
Specially Camera 📷....I claimed this camera is not 48MP. Something wrong here with camera specs ...I'm sure there is only 16MP camera quality. Not more then this.
And there is few more bugs am facing with this phone. Plus Screen Quality is Very Bad, specially in a Day time.....when u using phone in Outdoor,
Only Good point in this phone is... Fast Charging...it's get Charged very Quickly....

376,"This is my first OnePlus device, shifted from Moto G5s plus. One thing I can say that this phone is amazingly very fast, but not free from cons

PROS:

Speed
Performance
Display
Fast Charging

CONS:

Camera: The camera is similar to old OnePlus devices from 2 years ago, so not a big upgrade, also OnePlus ditched the telephoto lens and instead they gave us a useless macro lens. (Samsung galaxy FE camera combination is better)

Battery: Battery drains a bit quicker than expected, in my case it lasted around 5-6 hours of continuous usage.

No 3.5 jack: If your old phone had a headphone jack surely you'll miss it. But you can buy type C headphone or type C to 3.5mm cable.

No SD 865+ Chipset: It would really have been an improvement over OP 8 if there was SD 865+ instead of SD 865.

Heating: The phone heats a bit while charging I noticed, although not that a big deal.

Fingerprint Reader: It's average not too quick not too slow, but face unlock is very fast.

Color Variant: There should have been a black Matt finish color variant, although lunar silver is nice, but I would have chosen black over any other color if I had a choice. (Galaxy FE has great color variants but Exynos is not a great chipset, you don't get everything from a single phone they say)

Overall phone is good for first-time flagship users, I'll give 3 out of five stars as of now.",3.0
377,"Well I upgraded to oneplus 8t from oneplus 6 but I am not satisfied because the overall experience and built quality of the phone is not as good as the earlier version. Oneplus 8 does not feel as solid in the hand as oneplus 6 used to. Right from the alert slider that feels very fragile oneplus 6 used to feel very strong and the sturdy. Even the camera quality is not good at all, it's below-average, the colours are very washed off and they do not represent accuracy at all. I feel oneplus has done a quite a few compromises in building up the 8t and they are very evident and I don't think that after this version I will go for any other oneplus devices.",3.0
378,"The OnePlus 8T is my 5th OnePlus phone and I'm completely sold on the UI. It's really clean, minimal and fast. That's why I stick to OnePlus. But this time, my experience was different. There are a bunch of things which OnePlus has introduced which isn't practical.
Firstly, the 120Hz display is really useless. I cannot makeout the difference between the 60Hz and 120Hz settings whatsoever. It may make a difference which playing FPS games, but not many games support 120Hz right now. If you still decide to go with the 120Hz setting, the battery takes a big toll. It won't even last for half a day under normal usage. Speaking about the battery and charging, it has been disappointing. OnePlus claims 0-100% charging in 30 mins. But this has never happened. When I first got the phone, it could go from 0-100% in 40-45 minutes. Now, it needs atleast an hour. The charging speed has been deteriorating and so has the battery life. It's hard to get a complete day under average use. I constantly find myself looking for the power bank in the middle of the day.
The display has been really good on OnePlus phones. But this time, I see ghosting while scrolling and the deep blacks aren't deep enough like an AMOLED display should be.
The cameras are nothing but a disappointment. Instead of going for 4 average cameras, why not go for 1 or 2 excellent cameras?
Verdict:
OnePlus has lost its principles. It has become more of a gimmick than the practicality that it always stood for. The only reason why I'm still using the phone is for the seamless UI. Everything else is a fail. Instead of pulling all these gimmicks, OnePlus could have added features like wireless charging, IP68 rating. But all the choices were intentional, to downplay this phone and promote the pro variants. Really cheap game. This maybe my last OnePlus phone.",3.0

381,"I'm writing this review after 10 day's of usage.
Brought this phone on the first day of release.
Overall the phone is good
Because it has 120 refresh rate screen🧚⛷️- everything is butter smooth.
1 Plus has promised 3 years of software updates.
Its OS/UI (user interface) is great when you compare with other phone's - its clean and not so non sense app's are installed.
It's comes with 65w charger & u can charge phone just under 🔋40min - This is great.
But while charging the phone produce lot of heat 🌡️- better don't use the phone while charging (a suggestion 😁)
The worse part is the battery🔋only last for a day maximum.
The LED pannel is not so great as expected🦧.
Camara is average, selfie are great though.
Its doesn't provide 3.5 headphone 🎧 jack, and have to rely heavily on bluetooth headset.

Value for money 💰- i do feel it should have come between 37k - 40k bracket
Because nothing is new in this, it's doesn't come with 865+ Snapdragon, Camera 📸technology is 2 years old.
Doesn't have IP rating, like water💦 or dust 😷proof, so you can't guarantee or be sure when going out in rainy 🌧️season",3.0

What i don't like is the battery. It drains like hell when you sip a bottle of juice in heavy summer. I got SOT of max 5Hrs20min. The battery gets drained heavily even when you don't use the mobile.
When i used this in 60hz there was an inprovement in battery life.

And if you're deciding between the mi 10T/10T pro and the OP8t . Then do yourself a favour and get the mi 10T , you save a lot of money and still have a better overall phone than this.

406,"Purchased One Plus 8T as an upgrade to my One Plus 5, which I have been using for 3 years. Had high expectations but Super disappointed with this latest offering from One Plus.
1. Poor Network stability - My airtel sim faced constant disruptions while connecting to internet. (Was smooth in One Plus 5 at the same area). Used to keep my OnePlus 5 as a hotspot to no issues but 8T gave constant disruptions.
2. Less than impressive Battery life - Although battery gets charged to 100% in less than 40 mins, it gets drained fast as well. Charging speed is great owing to the 65w warp charger (My one Plus 5 charged faster as well)
3. Okayish Camera - Nothing special or great to be said to be camera as well. Expected a better camera at this price range.
Looks like One Plus is focussing on Nord this year, putting their least efforts in a very mediocre 8T.
The only pros are 120 Hz refresh rate ( which drains the battery) and the high RAM and storage options the phone provides.
There is no tap & pay option and wireless charging option, which is expected at this price range.
Suggest to look for other options at this price range or wait for better ones than going for 8T. There is no Return option for the phone as well.
Highly disappointed, One Plus! Probably the worst phone by One Plus. My One Plus 5 fared better.",2.0

1. Very much disappointed with the performance can't even imagine hanging problem in this price segment, after about one and a half month of use apps are crashing frequently, gallery and games are stop working and crashes multiple times a day, many times my phone was restarted by itself after being freeze for 30 to 40 seconds.
I can have this fun in any Samsung's phone in ₹10k price range why I wasted extra 33k god knows.
2. Camera quality is good but not best in class if you want a good camera phone please ignore this phone. iPhone is the best one to choose.
3. What to say about 120hz refresh rate it drained the battery like a monster. Not evan a day battery life.
4. Selfie primary camera is just worst and waste, viewing angle is very annoying not able to capture the full viewing angle image of the one who is taking selfie. Also colours and sharpness in portrait mode is below than average.
5. Secondary camera glass got scratches easily even I was using phone case. The case I got from one plus also have very poor quality plastic, got yellowish in just one month of use.

Pros:
1. 60 watt ultra fast charging is the only thing which makes a sense in 40 thousand + price range. But doesn't make a worth if drained pretty quickly.

After using Xiaomi, Apple, Google, Samsung, LG, etc... I can easily say OnePlus is not a great phone to buy. Even Xiaomi's avaerge phone would beat the OnePlus's flagship phone easily hands down.

The image stabilization is good for videos, not that great for the photos.
Now, if you are someone who is not bothered about camera, blindly go for it. I was using the one plus 5 for 4 years, I didn't have any problems with it. When it started showing problems, that's when I planned to change the phone. Since I had the trust that oneplus is good quality, that's why I decided to stick to this brand.

451,"This is not a ranting review, it's friendly advice that would save you some money and time.

I was using Oneplus 6 before upgrading to Oneplus 8T. Of course, wanted to experience that improved performance and high-quality display with a 120Hz refresh rate that everyone is talking about.

But, the problem with Oneplus 8T is the display itself. First of all, if you are getting Oneplus 8T, you gonna have screen issues straight out of the box.

Reference keywords for your Google research:
- Oneplus Purple Tint
- Oneplus Black Crush
- Oneplus Ghosting

Mine was Purple Tint.

Remember those old phones we used to use 8 years back that had this poorly made screens which looked sharp from the front but when you tilt it to a certain extent all the colours get washed?

Same happening here when I keep my phone brightness under 30%.

Secondly, the screen brightness is like an old tube light. When you increase or decrease your screen brightness using the toggle in the notification panel, it will take some time to respond to the change.

For example: if I increase my brightness from 30% to 70%, it will take a good half-second to respond to that change. Increasing brightness on this device is not instant on this device is all I am saying.

Sadly, the phone at this price point can't even keep up with the competition when it comes to the screen quality.

Lastly, I would highly recommend reading some Google reviews before buying this product.",1.0

Super fast charging

*No AQI by default in weather app
*No health app
*Basic useless calculator app
*No equaliser customisation available in music settings.

If we talk only about UI than MiUi and Honor UI is better than OnePlus. Every app in oneplus which is available by default is useless and only a burden on your mobile because you can't uninstall these apps and you have to install another apps in replacement of these junk apps.

Pros:
Excellent and smooth 120Hz display
Gaming experience is nice

Cons:
1) Battery backup is horrible possible reasons could be phone signal keeps on varying whereas my earlier phone OnePlus5T has stable signal strength. Even otherwise battery backup is horribly wrong

2) Adjusting screen brightness takes 1-2s delay to take affect

3) Camera quality is not upto the mark in indoors

4) while trying to make the phone 5G ready, I feel they have messed up 4G connectivity/signal things big-time.

461,"I was using Samsung before buying this phone. But when I heard the price, it felt like its offering flagship features for midrange value, so I bought it. Have to say this that its hardware and processor is best in class, but when it comes to UI it fails miserably. The features, ease of use and customisations that One UI provides are just on next level and can't be compared with the low level and totally buggy Oxygen OS. Its almost same like stock android with slight changes which are taken from One UI. Don't buy this if your old phone is Samsung, its just downgrade.

>>After a month :
Still the worst. And one more thing I observed is it is very bad handling OTG devices like HDD. And also it takes lot of time to load already existing files which is a huge problem when you are trying to move around the files.
* Buggy OS
* Not so good with handling files
* Not at all good with external devices through OTG
* No extra features as in One UI

>>After 6 months :
Well, it grew on me. I modified the UI to suit my needs, changed the icons a bit. Well it still fails to handle OTG devices. Thats the biggest flaw it has. Oneplus has to work on that.
Pros ::
* Back camera is quite good, you can get pretty good results in daylight.
* Runs smooth as butter, didn't notice any lag till date.
* Fingerprint scanner is quite good.
* Gets to 100% in no time. Love it.

Cons ::
* Not much customisations.
* Front camera is garbage, it takes you way back to 2000s cameras.
* Cameras fail miserably in low light conditions.
* OTG handling is the worst.
* Gets heated a lot. Just scrolling through Instagram or Google feed heats up the device.

* OTG still fails.
* File handling not good. Takes way too much time to load files in local storage.

Nightscape mode looked promising but zoom and not surprise Blur again. I wish samsung provide a 5g option next time. I will surely take less powerful processor but better camera.

492,"Worst device by one plus a far. I became a fan after buying and using OP6 so decided to upgrade to 8T and what a downfall! Firstly, the phone hangs A LOT! like a lotttttt! Whats the point of having the specs of a flagship phone when the OS is laggy?

Next is the camera/s, my older OP6 does a far better job at taking pictures and processing the HDR quality. The camera on this device makes everything being clicked from a fisheye lens.

The battery isnt great too, the charger though charges rapidly but the battery backup just sucks big time.

The absence of a 3.5mm jack is felt quite regularly

That being said, the best device so far from one plus has to be the 7T.

500,"I am a loyal prime user of Amazon and shop frequently. Never have been disspointed with the delivery and if at all I was not happy with the product, support team of amazon would always help me out.
So this time too the delivery was smooth and on schedule.
The Sony service center team did call us but I had already installed the TV by myself as it was pretty simple. Service center team came to our house and delivered the wall mount panel and also they informed that they will do free mounting . I didn't require the mounting at that time.

Finally about the product.

Display, viewing angles and Sound quality is good. But would suggest people to get a good soundbar for good cinematic experience. (always recommended for any TV).
The TV comes with smart features. It has dedicated YouTube and Netflix button on the remote. It has apps like prime, zee, yupp, Eros now, etc. I want to install Hotstar app but not sure if it is possible.
The only issue is the smart tv interface is too laggy. I guess the RAM is not sufficient enough. Other than that playback happens super smooth which depends on a good wifi connection.

So for a 43"" TV 38k is a bit high considering Chinese competitors like one plus giving at a much cheaper cost. But I paid a premium for a non Chinese company, Sony, which is also a made in India product and I have not qualms about it.

Update: one cannot install additional apps on any ""Smart TV"". It has to be an ""Android TV"" for any new application installation",5.0

The screen mirroring with phone and laptop works very smoothly. Built in apps - Netflix, Prime Videos, Youtube, Sony Liv, Zee5, Eros now, Big flix, Alt Balaji, Voot, Hungama Play.
Also, inbuilt browser and FM radio available.

 I have compared all available TVs in this category and price range. This one is the best option available in this segment, simply go for it.. If you are a fan of picture quality, then you can stop your search and buy this. it’s better than many of the cheap 4K TVs in this price range.

Sound quality is average, but it does the job for a normal size living room.. I am using a Bose sound bar and it gives awesome sound output from the HDMI ARC port. All latest sound bar can be used with this TV because it has an hdmi arc port.

Sony’s quality is always been top notch, but still built quality is not top class in this TV. Quality of plastic is average and fitment is flimsy. TV is made in India, power adapter is made in Indonesia, only the remote is China made..

Connectivity is also seamless. WiFi stays connected whole day without any interruptions.
You won’t regret a Netflix HD plan with this TV, simply awesome clarity.

There is a lag in loading i guess thats the Ram but then the internet experience is really good the buffering is nil actually until u try fast-forward or backward which still is ok and smooth. Dedicated buttons for youtube and netflix. Prime available but no hotstar. For hotstar the only way is screen mirroring (through browser.. through app the display had issues) which u know sucks..

I would like to point out 2 things though:
1. The TV doesn't support 5 GHz band. It only supports 2.4 GHz, which MIGHT cause some buffering issues while using the inbuilt OTT apps on TV. However, while testing out apps on TV (2.4 Ghz band), I did not have any issue. It might be because my Wifi router (with 300 Mbps speed) is kept right below the TV. However, you can feel the issue of slowness at 2.4 GHz, when you start using the pre-installed browser on TV to open 'Hotstar'. (Yes, Hotstar doesn't come with the TV and nor can you install the app).
I am anyways using Amazon Fire TV stick which supports 5 GHz band. If you are planning to use one too, you shouldn't worry at all.

2. It is very difficult to insert USB drives/ HDMI cables once the TV has been wall mounted. Personally, I did not like this, but most people can live with it.",4.0

523,"Very happy with this product. So far the only annoying feature encountered is that when it's powered on, it starts with the snowing screen with a loud sound. The sound is the only annoying thing. If there is a power outage and TV stops in high volume mode, when its restarted, it starts with a very high volume with the snowy screen. I have another smart TV- Samsung and that starts in the silent mode. So probably, this is a slip on Sony's part or maybe there is a setting to switch the sound off when starting, which I don't know, so giving it the benefit of the doubt. Pros - light n easy to move. Netflix n YouTube buttons on the remote make for quick access. TV is quick to respond unlike my old Samsung smart TV which has a notoriously annoying lag between remote action n TV response. The sound of this TV is OK. There is no hotstar preloaded. The navigation home menu is a little confusing as compared to my Samsung. Overall, this is a great buy for the money shelled out.",4.0

Pros :

2. Amazing Sound Quality. This is where SONY is at the top.

Cons :
1. Sound is low on the internet settings.The sound I am getting at 80% is equivalent to 30% on HDMI through amazon Firestick. Don't know why. I haven't tested on Cable antenna connection. I think a software update can fix this.
2. Yes, I am using firestick because this TV comes with very limited apps and that does not include Hotstar. moreover, additional apps cannot be installed.

The delivery was lightening fast as It got delivered within 12-24hrs ! The packaging was good. I had to wait for 2 more days as the installation had to be done by a Sony mechanic. The TV was in good shape, and the installation was done very fast. We already had a TV stand on which it was mounted.
I definitely noticed a change in the TV thickness; this new one was thicker than the previous one. But the mechanic assured that it is because this TV had separate Display and backlight panels, and it was a good thing as individual damage to these components can be repaired easily, unlike the previous one, where I will have to change the whole panel to correct and damage.
The screen looked nice and I had to tweak some adjustments to get the images to a level of picture quality I wanted. The sound
quality was adequate for our relatively smaller hall.
One problem I noticed was that the TV remote was not that good, as I was having problems with the home button, which is used to navigate to the preinstalled apps like amazon prime video. I had to press many times and had to press some other buttons to make it work. It had shortcut buttons for Netflix and Youtube, so those were not a problem. The connectivity seems okay for now (it was my main concern as many other budget TVs like MI TV were having connectivity issues).
This is the immediate review of the TV, and still need to spend some time for other functions. So far I think this has got value for money.",4.0

 Decent for the price. Couple of things to know before buying

Linux based , cannot load more apps like android. Hotstar is not available. Will need a firestick to watch anything other than Netflix , YouTube prime and vu . No optical fibre connection provided .

2. Sound is decent for a normal living space.
3. Picture quality is good. Full HD and no 4k
4. Hdmi arc and hdmi2 is available apart from aux and VGA

Also when the person came for installation he was constantly behind me to give a 5 star rating. when I told him I will do so later after using the product, he kept calling me for 2-3 days and insisting that I should give rating and email the screenshot to him I think that is why this TV has a higher rating because they get behind customers to give them a good rating but it is a very average as per what I have used it till now. The installation guy also told me to buy a 4K wire for connecting my TV to jio set top box which I don't think is required because if that was a requirement the company would have given a 4k wire with the TV itself.

550,"Picture not great (compared better quality Mi is great) not believe is it sony (Wi-Fi and inbuilt apps only no host star app Also) mirror cast options there.

You want sony tv in low cost this is the options. But no return and replacement ( if not like the tv)",3.0
551,Picture and sound quality of this tv is one of the best in the market. But the os is linux based and not android. Which means we cannot install additional apps from playstore and have to use only the preinstalled apps which comes with the tv. A browser is there but it is not too handy to use. So I suggest you to think before investing 35k only for the great sound and picture quality. If sound and picture is your priority then go for it. And if specifications are your thrust options then search other options.,3.0

Picture quality : 2.5/5, Do not expect much because of sony brand, I would say you get same feel when compared to TCL Tv. The picture quality is good, when there is low lighting in the house even tho you increase backlight of TV.

Sound: Average 2/3 clarity will be but you have to keep minimum 50-60/100.

Internet connectivity is good. Pre-installed apps runs smoothly can't install new apps and you cannot even use them browser.

Inbuilt Andriod Play Store, Youtube, Pathwall and Chrome Cast is amazing. You can play any file format including 4K content smoothly.

605,"This television is definitely a perfect balance between price and performance especially during flash sale at an exceptional price of ₹12500.

Performance ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
-----------------------
The processor in this Smart TV is powerful enough to play 4K 10bit HEVC videos right out of the box. VLC or MX player can be installed for enhanced media support.

Picture Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
--------------------------
Many people complain about the overbright screen. But it can be compensated by adjusting the display settings.
These are my preferred settings.

Backlight :1 to 20
*********************
During night even the lowest value of 1 is bright enough and can watch content without hurting eyes.

During day time adjust it as per your requirement depending on your ambient lighting conditions. A maximum of 20 would be enough.

Setting backlight to minimum improves black levels, reduces power consumption, increases LED life and reduces eye strain especially during night.

Brightness :48
*****************
Brightness setting controls black level.
Increasing brightness reduces black levels and hence reduces contrast.
Brightness at 50, pictures looks washed out with poor blacks and color saturation
At 45 black looks deep but lots of details at dark areas are lost while watching movies.
48 is an optimal setting to my eyes with good blacks and not so lack of details.

Contrast : 40 to 45
*********************
Contrast setting controls white level.
Contrast can be set anywhere between 40 and 45. Increasing contrast too much may cause highlight areas in a picture, like bright skies or shiny objects might look overexposed. As the screen itself is very bright, increasing contrast further makes whites look over bright. Also colors gets washed out while increasing contrast.

Saturation: 45 to 50
************************
Color saturation can be set anywhere between 45 to 50. At 45 colors look more natural. At 50 colors looks a bit punchy. But still its a personal preference.

At the above settings, the black levels and colors were pleasing while watching demo videos of OLED TVs on YouTube at 1080p . The following Youtube videos help you to check the black level quality of the TV.

LG 4K OLED Beauty Of Black Demo
LG OLED Eclipse 2 Demo
LG HD Demo Art Nouveau

Full HD and 4K videos looks sharp in this TV. Downloaded a sample 4K HEVC video named 'Life Untouched' and also a 4K HEVC sample of the movie Elysium. Both of them played smoothly on the TV with very good details.

Screen Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐
--------------------------
I think this is a VA panel , the quality of which sits right in between TN and IPS panels. The screen is glossy and hence reflective. This might be a problem if the TV is placed in a room with windows facing it.
Like all other LCD panels, this also has also got uneven screen uniformity but that's only noticed in plain dark grey backgrounds. While watching movies or other content it's not at all a problem.
Screen non uniformity is a common issue even with high end TVs of big brands like LG Samsung etc.
Luckily there's no backlight bleeding in the unit I received.

Viewing angles are average with some loss of contrast even at low angles but that's a common VA panel characteristic. IPS panels with good viewing angles can't be expected at this price point.
All LCD panel technologies have their strengths and weaknesses. IPS panels have good viewing angles but has poor black levels. VA panels excels in black depth despite it's average viewing angles and this TV has got very impressive black levels.

Sound Quality ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
--------------------------
Bass is a bit weak (I think bass is improved following some updates. So giving 5 stars from 4.) It's very loud even at low volume. Midrange and treble are very good. Even minute high pitched click and tick sounds in movies can be heard very clearly.

Edit:
In a previous review I have mentioned these EQ settings sounds good. But it isn't.
100Hz : 7
300Hz : 8
1000Hz : 4
3500 Hz : 6
10000 Hz : 5
A high value of 8 for 300 Hz actually make the sound muddy and muffled.

The following settings sounds much better and here's the reason.

100 Hz : 8 - Bass
Frequency setting for deep bass male vocals and instruments like Kick Drum,Toms, Snare etc.

300 Hz : 4 - Low Midrange
Enhances bass and depth of male vocals. Increasing 300Hz too much makes sounds muddy and muffled reducing clarity of high frequency sounds

1000 Hz : 3 - Midrange
Imparts a metallic tone. Increasing makes sound tinny and unpleasant.

3500 Hz : 5 - Upper Midrange
Vocals especially female sounds best at this frequency. A value of 5 enhances vocal quality. Increasing too much makes vocals harsh.

10000 Hz : 7 -Treble
Adds crispiness and sparkle to vocals and instruments. Enhances tinkling sounds of metallic instruments.

Human ear is sensitive to midrange and upper midrange frequencies Here it's 1000 and 3500 Hz. Setting these values too high can cause listening fatigue. Even increasing 300Hz is disturbing.

Great sound performance especially bass is not even expected from a television in this budget. But considering its midrange frequency, clear treble and loudness, it deserves 4 stars.

Remote Control ⭐⭐⭐⭐
-----------------------------
Minimalism is great. But minimalism with less functionality is not so great. Addition of
Mute,TV Settings and Video input selection buttons would 've made the remote more functional.

App support ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐(Update)
-----------------------
When the TV was released there was no support for Netflix and Amazon Prime. But now with Pie update it supports both Netflix and Amazon Prime. Now the TV deserves 5 stars for app support.

Pros and Cons
---------------------------

Pros:
1. Powerful processor for 4K media playback.
2. App installation via USB
3. Built in Chromecast
4. Bluetooth remote
5. Voice Command

Cons: (Update)

Previously the main issues with the TV were the lack of Autoplay function and Standby option.
But in the latest update both these issues are solved.

Now when the TV is turned on it will automatically go to the previous Input source
To enable it, go to Settngs >Inputs > Enable 'Stay on the previous source' option.
Screen off feature is also added in the new update. Long pressing Power button will show Screen Off option.

The only disadvantage left on the TV was lack of Miracast. But on a latest update build PI.4316 miracast is included and now its perfect.

To sum up:
--------------------

Overall considering the picture quality, powerful hardware and the price, the TV definitely deserve 5 stars devoid of it's average audio quality and the glossy screen because there are no other TVs in market with such features at this price point. Also Xiaomi now has got very strong service support across India.
New brands like iFFalcon, Blaupunkt ,Thomson etc might provide better options at a competitive price. But when it comes to service centres, it's a dead end.

I am very much satisfied with the purchase.",5.0
606,"Bought the MiTV 4A PRO 43"" during dussehra sale. I own a Micromax FHD LED tv (not smart TV) & an LG UHD tv.
Here is what i felt after using the Mi TV
1. For the discounted price, it's worth the buy!
2. This tv doesn't come close to the LG one. LG costs higher. Both picture & sound quality is much better than MiTV. WebOS, even though has lesser apps than android, is much better designed & responsive than MiTV's OS
3. Patchwall OS that comes with the MiTV is waste. So is the remote, when comparing to LG's magic remote.

So far, you might think this is a biased review.

When compared to Micromax.
1. The FHD tag on Micromax is a sham. Even my phone screen looks better. MiTv has much superior video & audio than Micromax.
2. Had seen some users reporting about os complaints with the MiTV. I faced no such issue. Os lags alot, snail pace to boot up & update, but never unresponsive. I use only apps that i need, no junk apps are allowed to run.
3. Got the update to Android 9.0, along with Netflix & prime apps. Really worth the update.
4. Patchwall is a sham. Content is waste, not free also.

Final verdict: If you are in a budget range, know how to use a smart tv, go ahead. Compared to my Micromax FHD tv, the picture is really superb. Micromax can't even get close to this quality.
Compared to my LG, both are inferior in terms of quality, features & performance",5.0

 This is quick review after installation for those who are about to buy, will repost if there are other observations.
To the point feedback: Dont think further go for it!

Pros:
TV supports netflix and prime video after update, side loading not required (check screen images )
YouTube after update works flawlessly
Screen mirroring as expected (minor lag as with all screen mirror apps )
HD videos works excellent.
4k videos are a treat to eyes.
Side loading of apps easy peasy task.
Low power consumption 4star rated tv.
Amazon service excellent (delivery & installation) installation team called 4 times to confirm after installation.

Cons:
Dedicated mute button missing (can use google assistant to mute by giving voice command).
Restarts couple of time if software is not updated,wich means without internet it might give some trouble for basic users.
Sound quality can go better with this type of tv.
Google assistant can go a bit better as at times mic doesn't recognise the command.
Some sideloaded apps not work as expected.
Could have provided extra memory as its a smart tv and buyer would like to load many apps wich requires extra space.

Got an update from MI....Amazon Prime is available now :)",5.0
609,"MI has claimed Indian market on the mobile category though I don't own one, but my friends and relatives experience has been great.
With that in mind, I bought this TV.

Pros:
1 )Slim design and Bezels maintained as much as possible to the edge, weighs barely 4 kg.
2) Multiple ports including Ethernet, HDMI, USB, wifi, Built in chrome cast, Always connected to my broadband.
3) Audio quality is good with DTS-HD, Android Oreo UI is great and it's fast as well.
4) TV quality is good, if you have HD DTH that would be great, no problem with viewing angles.
5) Smart TV UI has various customization options, I also installed some apps that provide Free shows, movies, like Hotstar, Jio TV, Jio cinema, Movies HD. Some of these have many inventory of free HD movies and shows and ofcourse YouTube. Also you can update apps to get the latest changes. Really worth it.
6) MI patchwall is awesome, it's similar to Hotstar with many freebies including Erosnow, Jio cinema, Hooq and Epic.
7) Bluetooth remote with Google assistant works like a charm also Built in Chromecast also works fast with phones.
8) TV stand that came with it is strong and strudy, still I mounted it on wall, not through them, I bought a Swivel mount so that I can swing it to side to side when required.

Overall I don't think why no one will buy this for such a steal!

Cons:
The only con I found worthy of posting is this.

1) Prime video support.
It's amazing or unbelievable! I'm buying this from Amazon through prime, yet they haven't partnered with MI !
Prime video app fails in this TV! Why Amazon? I think MI and Amazon should work it out for prime video support.
I'm currently watching prime via a workaround. I downloaded chrome and logging in prime via Mouse attached to USB, like PC and watching it.

PS:

As I said before in the cons, I read that they will plan to put an OTA update for prime video soon.
Those who are bashing this TV, expect an OLED TV quality from 14-15k! And probably should check their phone networks (WiFi and data) before chromecasting. I didn't have any problem.",5.0
610,Very nice product sound quality is amazing and vedio quality is like a HD overall this is awesome,5.0
611,"This time Amazon took long to deliver my product as there was durga puja holidays. Item reached my nearest hub very fast. But from there it took 4 days to reach at my home.
Now I will enter into my main review. I opened the package myself. There was free table top installation but I was so much excited and hence I unbox and installed myself. I was really worried about the quality of the TV as well as the picture quality. After turning on the tv when the display appears and I saw the entire display is intact then I feel myself safe.
Automatic android and app finalizing will be done. Just you have to provide the google account details. It will take not more than 10 mins.
Now coming to the picture quality. I am using a normal set top box of siti cable. So I really didn't check the quality with that. The picture is so brighter. I adjusted manually. And when I lowered all the paremeters, found very eye soothing. Colour quality is very good. I have a samsung full hd tv. And this is a HD ready tv. I found this mi tv's colour is very soothing and eye relaxing.
Then I checked with HD video in youtube. I really amazed with the display quality. This TV really gives a masterstroke playing the HD videos. I feel this HD ready TV's picture quality is more fine than my samsung full hd tv.
Every time I spoke to the remote and it understand my every word. And play automatically. You need a good wifi connection otherwise google will delay to listen your words.
I will not give full marks for the sound quality. The voice quality is very nice. But bass is very low. But it is nice and loud.
I really recommend the TV to everyone who are not a brand lover. Just have a try. No doubt you will be feel amazed.
I got panicked viewing some negative reviews. I don't know with which tv they are comparing. But with respect to a hd ready tv it is a must buy cheapest all rounder tv.",5.0
612,"Review after extensive use of 4month:
Buy date: 15Aug2019
TV size:43 inches
Living room size:15ft×15ft
1. Great sound quality. 20W is enough for my living room. No need of extra speakers.
2. Picture quality is superb. Use HD pack of your settop box.
3. Worth buying this product on amazon. Delivery is on time. No damage. Delivery person is also polite.
4. Installation on same day of delivery.
5. Voice recognition from remote is also great.
6. As its a android tv you have playstre in it. So download any app you want. Ofcource tv version of app should be available on playstore.
7. Once had issue when I upgraded the android version of tv. Colours got distorted. But called the MI guys immediately. As service center was availble in my city so MI guy respoNded immediately. Person said motherboard needs to be changed as newer version is not supported by your tv. By no time he changed it and its working absolutely fine.
8. I am using WiFi and bluetooth too much extensively. And never lagged at all.
9. Its not like price is low so you have to compramise some where,; I have compared many barnds tv like samsung,lg,mi etc live in showrooms all looks some what same. You wont see any differnce as per picture quality and sound.
10. Just one word. Fantastic. Go for it without a second thought.
11. Suggestions: Now 4k versions are also available.",5.0
613,"This is the best smart TV at this price range.
Lot of apps are preloaded (including Youtube & Hotstar). Prime Video and Netflix is also expected soon. So what... you can play prime videos in your mobile and do a screen cast. It plays seamlessly.
Google voice assistant works well. Remote is Bluetooth and light weight. Sound quality is good and loud. Using this TV for bedroom and it’s wonderful. Picture quality is nice and viewing angles are decent.
Delivered in 2 days and installation was completed the next day:) without any hassle. I didn’t have to call the Technician at all. He called me in the morning and kept me informed about the time of his arrival. He came and finished installation on time. You have to pay for wall mount though.
Packaging quality was good. Got additional extended warranty of 1 year as festive offer along with 10% instant discount and 1000 amazon pay balance as cashback.
Before you complain about the TV, keep in mind the price of the TV as well. What else can you expect in this price? Our expectations of the product must be in line with the price we pay. This TV is a full value for money.",5.0
614,"Just got this one delivered and installed the same day and it is fantastic!

Recently, I discarded my samsung 32"" smart tv with nearly same specs but this one is way SMARTER than samsung and with patchwall+oreo, it multiplies the user experience!
sound quality is better as compared to samsung and picture quality is somewhat same. Although, one thing I am missing is direct screen cast(Samsung TV had an input option as screen mirroring) .There is no such option yet but an update and I will check whether screen cast is available or not after the update. I can use the built-in chromecast , but it requires both devices to be on same network with internet connectivity (WiFi) and I discontinued my WiFi due to some reasons.
Also, there is no option to set AV or HDMI input as default, i.e. You have to select AV each time you want to watch TV, which is absolutely no problem to me, but it disturbs my parents, but they will cope up.

Rest, everything is fine and I got this for 12,500 (1500 instant discount+1000 rs. cashback) .

This is a must buy SMART TV.

There are some tips:
> Do not open the box yourself (wait for technician otherwise if anything happens, you are responsible)
> If you opted for wall mount, do not pay a penny more than 400
> Visit the website provided for installation request and contact the xiaomi customer care number if you need any help.
> Buy battery beforehand as they are not provided in TV

I will update this review after some time.",5.0
615,"Very good option for average leaving room size of 13x10.
Pixel rate is less as compared to 42inch version but still enough results when seen from 10 feet. Design is also looks decent when wall maunted.
I feel, YouTube is taking little extra time when we started, but if we turn off TV and start again, YouTube will resumes from where we closed. Good upgrade!
Google assistant, Prime videos, Netflix quick buttons are available on the remote control.

This could be the excellent option with minimal budget.",5.0
616,"Here is my first week experience!
Got the tv on Thursday and the Amazon installation was scheduled for Saturday. The installation happened as scheduled.

On the tv, oh it takes ages to load. Mine took 1hr to load only then i realised i had to turn on the power switch. The screen yeah, when i push it... it goes beyond gilgit baltistan and towards Karachi. And then i decided not to push so far. Regarding free content i decided to contact Sundar Pichai to see if MI tv purchasers can be given free access to everything premium. Still waiting for confirmation from him.

And besides all the above my MI Android tv works just fine. A brilliant tv for 22k that i paid. Can connect my laptop and mobile device to it. Loading time was not even a minute. Just set it up with your Google account and then navigation is a breeze. This is my bedroom tv and absolutely good looking. Go for it and don't believe the many low ratings as rightly pointed out by one reviewer... they expect 100k performance from a 30k tv.",5.0

The TV is awesome... was a steal during prime day .... with discount plus cashback....great sound quality... picture quality is perfect..... pre installed apps- netflix, prime, youtube, patchwall, etc... u can update apps ... to get hotstar, ndtv news etc.... its a breeze to connect with your device... signed up on google to make things easier... installation was also so quick... recommend to keep 2 AAA batteries handy for tge remote, without which installation cannot be completed... rest all good :)",5.0
620,"You all must have read the reviews regarding specs, performance etc. My review is based on view point of a normal user, even more so from a user who has just upgraded from CRT.

Put on HD subscription (DTH or cable) and then you will see the picture quality. It's awesome. The 32 inch HD ready model is an ideal size for HD channels as they generally are 720p.

You can see the attached pictures for estimating picture quality, the second one is from YouTube at 720p.

From the experience I had at Xiaomi Service Center with my phone, I can gladly tell you can trust it's service.

After the update, the sound quality is subtly improved.

The best thing about this is, you can even cast your laptop using chrome, I don't think others provide this application.

Amazon Prime is soon to be supported and Netflix isn't. I can live with that.

Don't worry if you don't find any music apps in play store. Just tell Google assistant what you wanna play and it will play in whatever app you want, be it gaana, Saavn or wynk.

So yeah, no complaints so far. I would advice you to use a stabilizer IF you are using government's electricity service.

And yes, don't book your installation on Sunday even if it shows it's available, they are not.

To those who are saying you can't make AV or any of the HDMI as default. Go to APPS - Live TV, add this to favorites, so you can directly access cable from interface. Now in Patchwall whichever mode you will select, will be set as default when you open Live TV app from interface, there you go!

Go for it!",5.0
621,Excellent product overall rating good but I don't know why MI dosnt provide brackets place TV on wall. This thing is very poor. Why customer should buy this separate?

623,"I did research a lot about this tv before buying and I found that there is screen mirroring issue but still went for it. Yes, Casting is working fine but screen mirroring doesn't work. My purpose was to see live free cricket matches on hotstar via screen mirroring. But now I can cast hotstar app to tv from my phone which works free from jio sim. In short my purpose is fulfilled via this work around.
Best budget smart android tv. Casting is working fine but screen mirroring doesn't work.
Amazon prime, youtube, hotstar is working fine. Typing is difficult so I use voice recognition feature and it works too good. Also tested bluetooth speakers connectivity, it also works great.

Overall awesome. Must go for it.",5.0
624,"Really a value for money product. I had to buy this after my age old CRT tv broke down beyond repairs. Got only 500 for it under exchange. The only problem I faced in first 3 months was the issue in connecting to home wifi, it used to take many minutes & multiple attempts to get it connected to wifi. But after a software update in January 2019, it started working well & now connects to home wifi quickly. The picture quality is quite good, looking at the price point of about 12k, bought it in Oct 2018. It connects & remains paired with my JBL Flip 3 bluetooth speaker easily. Streaming from my Samsung, Redmi & Lenovo mobiles is also easy over wifi. Voice recognition also works well. Very limited number of apps are enabled for android TV, however, you can also install additional apps using APK files from USB. Ok for browsing the Internet - had to download Puffin Browser. It takes sometime to get used to the quite hard remote buttons. Remote is very slim & sleek. As the remote is Bluetooth enabled, no need to point it directly to TV. I wish there was a direct setting to open/start the DTH/Cable input by default, as it is quite difficult to operate for elders in the family, as they don't know the remote navigation functions. I read someone complaining about not being able to install and run apps like Amazon Prime & Netflix on this TV. Please note that it is Amazon & Netflix's decision to not support this Android TV. Hence don't blame Xiaomi for this issue. It is due to the corporate fight between Google vs Amazon & Netflix. And has nothing to do with the capabilities of this TV.",5.0
625,"I would definitely recommend the device! It was certainly worth the money for me. The only thing to be wary of is this particular version connects only to a 2G connection and it’s best to have the TV close to where the modem is in your house. There are connectivity issues if the TV is far away, so do be wary of that. If you aren’t able to have the modem near your TV, a WiFi extender too works perfectly fine. As soon as I bought an extender and placed that near the TV, I had absolutely no issues and the TV’s working beautifully. It comes with a stand and a remote. The picture is super clear, the sound is lovely and it was an almost seamless experience connecting my goggle account to the TV. It is an android TV so if you have an android phone that’s fantastic, but having an Apple iPhone doesn’t really make it difficult either, chrome helps in casting if there’s a need and there’s no real issue outside of that for me at least.",5.0
626,"Best SMART TV at lowest rate with almost most features.
Pros:
1. Really smart. Lots of apps
2. Reads Hard disks without trouble.
3. Plays all .mkv files with x264 codecs. Sometimes Plays 1080p videos also seamlessly.
4. Has inbuilt apps like youtube,hotstar, etc., can download more from Play store.

Cons:
1. A bit slow sometimes. have to switch off/on sometimes.
2. Mirroring is very slow. Only high end phones work smoothly.
3. Do not load more apps.
4. Volume is low for large rooms

Verdict: If u want to enjoy the SMART TV features at a lower rate, this MI TV is the best choice. But if u need Real feature rich SMART TV, then go for other top brands like SONY, SAMSUNG.",5.0
627,"Packaging was standard and unpacking didn't take extra effort. Had to run to neighborhood shop to buy battery cells for the remote before installation though. Would be great if Xiaomi starts shipping batteries in the box.

Lightweight, comes with a placeholder stand. If you want to mount it on a wall, you need to buy wall mount separately. Remote looks very fancy and has minimal buttons which makes navigation a cakewalk for everyone from children to elderly.

Setup was quick and easy. Just following one screen instructions worked. If you find it difficult, amazon offers free on-site installation. Connecting to Wifi, Bluetooth devices, DTH was simple, without any glitches.

I am very happy with the TV. Keeping in mind that it's a entry level value for money product; the picture quality, sound, ease of connectivity and navigation are awesome and in some cases better than higher value products like Samsung in the similar size.

The TV runs on Android so your watchlist, history etc are synced between all common apps on your phone, computer and the TV. The inbuilt Patchwall launcher is great for average user but if you are looking for advanced customization, don't set it as a default one and customize your android homepage. I also tried Chromecast from my phone. It worked smooth. Overall, if you are looking to upgrade to a smart TV and don't have extra ordinary demands, this is your pick! 👍",5.0

Mi TV team require to provide software update to eliminate initial some bugs. Be aware, everytime when you switch on the TV you have to select input source like AV or HDMI which is a real problem for old age people. Mi TV team please do the needful to solve the issues otherwise you may lose your market share on this particular model. Buyer can go with this product blindly because of its price tag and quality. Some user complaining about Chromecast etc but I believe mi TV team aware of that through the users feedback and they will definitely provide an update to solve those issues soon. Thanks.

Disadvantages:
1) Brightness Is very less (100% is not enough for living room in day time)
2)Feels little lagy after using 1 month as i use Netflix, hotstar, YouTube and prime only in tv
3) Inbuilt speakers are useless to watch movies/shows (Must buy add on like boat bar or some other good one and it's awesome with that to watch movies)
4)Takes 1 min nearly to open when we turn on tv

Everything fine under this price and all good except...

637,I got a 43 inch Mi TV Smart 4A from Amazon.in. The Delivery was fantastic (in 2 days) and installation in another two days. I did the installation myself although the guy was courteous enough to come and check just for the sake of it. Picture quality is brilliant compared to the price at which they are offering the TV. Best to view HD channels on DTH platforms as picture and sound are much superior than cable. The sound is a bit disappointing but I will still go with it because of the awesome price the TV comes for. You can go for a soundbar for more surround effects. Good buy and I suggest you go for it rightaway!,5.0

Subsequent installation process was smooth & the executive was polite & well mannered.",5.0
639,"I've bought this TV for 15k but now the price is reduced to 14k. For the price I paid, I'm completely satisfied with the product.
Build quality of the TV feels fine for me as I should not expect much for the price I've paid. It's above average. The panel looks good, not the best one out there but it's good for the price, you won't get any better panel at this price point as of now. It supports videos upto 4k which is great thing in my opinion. The speakers on this TV are surprisingly loud but there is no bass at all. So, I would recommend you to connect some good external speakers to it for better sounding experience.
If you're planning to use table stand on this TV then you have to increase the diameter of the holes on this TV by tightening and untightening the screws 3 or 4 times in each hole for perfect fit of the stands. I really like the Chromecast feature of this TV, and mainly it's an android TV. The reason that I'm mentioning it as an Android TV is that most of the other brands claim theirs as smart TVs but most of them won't run on android, they just install some multimedia apps and some other apps on the TV and advertise them as smart TVs. But this TV is a pure smart TV as it runs on android Oreo 8.1, I've received two OTA updates since the day I purchased it. If you're planning to buy this TV, I would suggest you to connect this TV to the internet as initial setup takes around 20 mins to go to the home screen. You can install prime video app on this TV too by downloading it from third party websites and installing it via USB. Overall, very satisfied with the product.",5.0

- Chrome fast works seemlesly no 3rd party app required
- Best part is voice button, you say it and you get it.
- prime works seemlesly once installed
- if you have budget go for higher size its worth as the after sales service is good, just download the app and people chase you within 24 hours of raising ticket

 The MI 32 Inch TV is below 15K price TV. You can call top performer in this segment.

In discount scheme, one can get this TV below 13K.

Can produce quite loud sound with acceptable quality.

Picture quality wise it's great.
Color reproduction is very good, comparable to samsung, LG.

Android OS is working good. (If installing too many apps, then it may slow down due to 1GB RAM)

Voice control in remote do not works all times. (My remote do not recognise voice many times)

The only drawback is it's durability, you can feel the delicate nature of it's build. So handle with care and don't expect much if you require maintenance after warranty.

650,"I got it (43"") in 20k during sale. Worth every penny. Only downside is that it doesn't have IPS panel even though its a full hd tv which doesn't make sense, I am not a gamer but gamers deserve IPS panel when they are buying a full hd tv so 1 star less only because it doesn't have IPS panel because this same model has IPS panel shown by Tech Singh on his YouTube channel but end users are not getting the same.

Amazon prime and Netflix is supported and will be automatically added when you update to the android version 9 or above which is available OTA, go to settings and check for updates.

Those who need subtitles for watching movies should know that the default video player doesn't support subtitles so if you want to watch videos with subtitles you should install vlc player, just make sure that the video file and subtitle file has the same name, just open the vlc player and give permission to storage and all your video files will be showing in vlc app, just click on the video u wamt to watch and subtitle will automatically work.

Next day delivery by Amazon even during big sale and same day installation by Xiaomi on delivery date. Kudos to both for this.

Remember, keep ₹500 ready if you want wall mount during installation. That is the price for wall mount only, if you don't take wall mount then you don't have to pay anything and get the installation done as table top.

This is initial review just wanted help to those who think that this tv doesn't have amazon prime and Netflix or that it doesn't support subtitles.

There are Hundreds of review on this TV here as well as on youtube, but NONE explains the TV's potential completely and what its actual flaws are. Here's a quick Fact for the User's complaining about the LESS cost to benefits ratio, guys if you buy a Android TV box alone which has processing capacity similar to this tv, then it would alone cost you more than 5K rupees & here you get this TV with that android setup with various other feature under 15K. So just check once, what options you have before complaining.
Eventually I bought this TV, since I was already using 4A 43 version for months and wanted smaller version for bedroom. Now after using this TV for over 3 weeks, I am stating my DETAILED user experience. Its a detailed & huge review, but do read it, if you want to invest this much amount.

●● If you want to get quick overview of the device, then read below else scroll down for Detailed Review ●●
# Firstly its budget friendly & ONLY Smart TV under 15k in the current market.
# Has Most number of Output port ( 1*AV, 3*HDMI, 2*USB ).
# Has Android 8.1 out of the box along with inbuilt Bluetooth
# Has Dual interface - MI Patchwall & Android TV ( I mostly prefer android TV interface )
# Remote has Bluetooth & Voice Search with sleek profile.
# Has better processor compared to predecessor along with 1GB RAM + 8GB storage ( 4.7GB actual )
# Speaker Output is low.
# Need IR cable for using set top box with android interface.
# Amazon prime & Netflix is NOT preloaded, but can be side loaded.
# Native Display is ONLY HD, though 1080p & even 4K videos from youtube works well (check images attached).
# Can install & play tons of High quality games like RR3, etc (check images attached).
# Finally smartphone mirroring works fine most of the time.

FULL DETAILED REVIEW :---->

BUILT QUALITY :
------------------
# Has combination of plastic and aluminium for the main body. Its not great, but above average.
# Table top stands looks bit flimsy, but are workable.
* The screws which are provided in the box, DOES NOT fits the tv perfectly, so I bought new from local store.
# It has averagely slim profile, not the slimmest in the market.
# Speaker Placement is inconvenient. Since they are placed at the bottom, so when you keep it on table top, the sound tends to dampen and bulge.
# Has good ventilation for electronics and it hardly heats up.
# Overall built quality is above average.

DISPLAY QUALITY :
---------------------
# It has very Thin bezels, which looks great.
# Video resolution is 1366x768p, but 1080p videos works fine on it.
* 4K videos on youtube runs smoothly as well.
# Viewing angle are good compared to price. ( Check the images attached )
# Contrast is above average, Brightness is good and colours are quite vivid.
# Display quality is also above average, not very great.

REMOTE CONTROL :
-----------------------
# Its very sleek and compact.
# Has only 7 buttons and is easy to operate.
# Fortunately it has Volume buttons, which is handy. ( I have couple of android TV boxes without volume button on remote, so I know the pain of using mouse to adjust the volume :P )
# Placement of Voice search button is improper. Its just below Power button, and I end up pressing power button a lot.
# Finally its bluetooth, so no need to point it towards tv for operation.

OTHER FEATURES :
---------------------
# It has Dual interface, i.e. Patchwall and android TV. Has tons of content.
# Many games can be installed (till you have memory left), including multiplayer games.
# Google voice search is very useful, if you don't want to use keyboard.
# Processing speed is fast and I haven't detected any lags yet. ( Lags in streaming can be due to slow internet speed, not due to hardware )
# Bluetooth and wifi connectivity works perfectly.

CONS :
------
# Speaker output though rated 20W, is NOT upto the mark. My 16W JBL speakers has better and louder sound.
# Placement of speaker is inconvenient, as in table top position, speakers face the table and sound dampens.
# Internal Memory is very LESS.
# NO Netflix and amazon prime pre loaded, though you can side load them.
# Miracast not supported. Even normal smartphone mirroring lags sometimes.
# Native resolution is just 720p HD, though the 1080p videos works on usb & 4K on youtube.
# Screen is Slightly reflective, its similar to almost all the other LED tv's.
# Mixed experiences of after sales service.

CUSTOMER CARE :
--------------------
# Firstly the installation is a Joke. My installation was scheduled 16 days after my product Delivery and the fun part is, there's ONLY 10 days replacement window for this product :P
# Company only takes replacement if the product is opened by their Representative, so there's NO point of return window time frame.
# MI has mixed reviews for repairs and services. Though I have not encountered any problem with any MI tv yet, I have had issues with other mi products and service center near me is always very helpful.

VERDICT :
-----------
Considering all the facts, if you are fine with above average Display quality, want a Smart tv and if you have tight budget, then this the TV you should certainly go for. Trust me, you won't get any better deal than this least for coming couple of months. If you have higher budget, then certainly explore brands like sony, samsung, etc.
This is NOT a perfect smart TV, but for the given price and 2 Years of warranty, its NO brainer to choose this, its certainly worth the investment.",4.0
654,"Promptly delivered by amazon. Installation delayed and rescheduled. Awesome picture Quality. Sound very clear.
Needs improvement Amazon Prime and Netflix not preloaded. Bluetooth is not capable of connecting beyond 6ft. 4k videos do not play
Internet connection should be stronger than 20mbps for a streaming videos..
Overall good set with reasonable price.",4.0
655,"Good TV and I am happy with it. Picture quality is good, sound quality is resonable. Packing and delivry by amazon were as usual good. Voice recognition could have been a bit better but that would be nit picking. For those who have issues with Prime Video and Netflix not being included in the boquet, believe me, casting from the mobile apps for both of them works like a charm, tried it out myself. And for those who feel that casting is not an option, buy an amazon fire stick and you would still be better off from the ""overall dent in the wallet"" standpoit.

Update - Nov 3, 2019 - In order to make things complete, Xiaomi has done an Over The Air update of the software which has brought both Netflix and Prime Video as part of the pre-installed apps.
The software has also been upgraded to the next version of Android. As such, at this price, this is a steal !!!",4.0
656,"Pros:
- The TV looks good. Has a nice aesthetic appeal.
- Picture quality is good. I bought the 32 inch HD Ready one. It's not entirely HD, but you can play HD stuff on it.
- The Patchwall OS has received a nice upgrade from the previous one. So the content is more manageable and fluid.
- The voice assistant feature is a nice edition to the remote. Not very fast, but still a nice feature to have!
- Built-in Chromecast, so you can directly stream content from you device which is also pretty neat! (With some limitations)
- Accessible PlayStore with a large variety of apps available directly(Some limitations)

Cons:
- As you must have heard, there's not Netflix or Prime default support. You have go through a little manual process to get them working. Even then you can't use Netflix without a mouse and a keyboard(A later update has solved this keyboard issue, yet to test)
- You do have access to the Google PlayStore, but some important apps are restricted. So it's a feature, but not entirely useful.
- The built-in chromecast also doesn't allow you to stream Netflix or Prime content. You have to download them seperately (sideload)
- The assistant doesn't work if you attach headphones to the TV, so just a warning to anyone who uses it that way.
- Sound quality is not that great. There's very limited bass. Although the sound is quite high, it doesn't have a nice quality to it. It sounds flat sometimes

Overall, A decent TV with nice picture quality. Built-in chromecast within a good budget. Can access blocked apps through sideloading. So only purchase it if you're ok making changes to the tv and installing apps from outside sources",4.0
657,"TV is good at this price range. Picture quality is good for hd videos. Audio is loud but quality is average. Wifi is slow. Mirroring is problematic but sometimes works ok. Lastly, delivery service of amazon is very bad. 1 star for that. Ordered on 9th and TV was delivered on 20th. The irony is that distance between warehouse and my home is only 250 kms. MI installation service is prompt. Installation request was placed in the evening and the installation guy came next morning. Overall average TV.",4.0
658,"1.Display picture quality is not as bright and lovely as of LG tv but LG is costlier so its ok.best for bedroom not for a well lit large room .
2.RCA audio out missing optical out missing.only spdf out is there (coaxial)so not very handy
3.two usb ports are so close that you can use them with an extension male female cable
4.They do not provide wall fitting or even Cells of remote .so chinese !
5.if light goes and comes after a while ,it will not be ON automatically ,tou switch it on and it will take full time to switch on then unnecessary informations again like usb drive connected etc,you keep on pressing back button
OTHERWISE IT IS BEST AS OTHER MI PRODUCTS AT THIS PRICE .😊voice remote is good but not as responsive as Amazon fire tv
bluetooth out is there thank God",4.0
659,"well i got the TV today intact, loved the packaging, no harm done to the hardware. now coming to the installation, contacted the store through the link in the mail i received for installation, the guy was polite, did in 10 minutes and left (no charges). in the box, there was one remote, one tv, table top stand and the ac adapter, although i thought the delivery man will give the AAA batteries for the remote but nevermind, thats hardly an issue to consider. the audio quality is great for a 11k TV with android OS as its base. I read reviews about how netflix nd prime was not deployed. So, as soon as i started the TV, i ran a update check nd found the update of Android 9. the TV came with version 8. in the new version, it eas clearly stated that its now supporting the netflix and lrime officially. the update was of 825 mb. after the update the netflix was preinstalled nd prime was easy to install through play store. both are running seamlessly. coming to casting, yes it is possible through google home app, and if ur phone is having inbuilt casting mechanism then too no problem at all. i casted my phone nd it worked like a charm. video quality is great. i ran 720p, 1080p nd 4k, and it was running without any stutter or lag. the customization is pretty great. the UI is catchy and easy to understand nd use. The voice recognition feature works well, although you need the internet connection to make it work for anything. what i think is Xiaomi should at least enable the recognition system for basic local tv functions. I meant that yes i can turn the volume up nd down, change channels by speaking, but that too requires an internet connection. please resolve this. also, there is no mute function on Mi tv remote. i know its hard to change the hardware but u can give an update where we can press or hold a certain button to mute and unmute. most of the content to watch is free and yes its categorized in a great way. the table top atand is sturdy. the look is sleek and classy. loved the product. great job Mi. and please take the two things i mentioned into consideration in ur next update, the mute thing and the localization of voice assistant for basic rv functions. and to the negative reviewers, if u r asking for a smart tv, then at least be smart to explore everything from start to end, then place ur conclusions, nothing would be spoon feeded to u guys. thanks. have a great day.",4.0
660,"After using and tweaking it a lot, here's what i think about this TV.

pros
- great picture quality
- great volume and clarity
- hdmi works great for upto 1080x1920 resolution, although the TV is 1366p, but it supports fullHD without any lag and issues...
- Miracast works amazingly well(chromecast is buggy as always)
- Voice Assistant works very well, the remote is great, very responsive.... (but i like to use android remote, since over wifi it's faster than bluetooth remote)
- everything is working just fine, without any issues.

cons
- lack of Dynamic Range Control or any Dolby Audio, so during movies you better need to turn the volume down for action scenes
- chromecast is awful, and doesn't work, it connects but screen mirroring and casting is very buggy.
- patchwall is not customisable, so better use android launcher, which there is.
- you can't remove netflix and prime video, which i think should be an issue for many. Not a problem for me, since I just use them both
- 1080p or 2160p videos on YouTube won't create that much impact, since it's not a FullHD TV.",4.0
661,"I got this LED Tv at Rs13499 at first sale, i like the features below is the some Pros and Cons

Pros:
Built in google apps including playstore so you can download any app you want very easily.
Built in Chromecast which is a very great feature, i love this
It has both android and patchwall. so you can feel the customized features that Mi has put in patchwall.
8 GB internal memory out of with you will get 4.2GB for your use remaining is already occupied by android system.
It supports Bluetooth which will help you to connect your Bluetooth speaker, Keyboard, mouse, headphone etc.
It also has google voice assistant so senior members of family would easily operate it.
Remote is Bluetooth connected.

Cons:
Default color settings are little fade but i customized it from settings.
They don't give wall mount and remote batteries in the pack so you'll have to spend more than 400 above the base price of LED.
I felt LED stand is not that good. It was of cheap quality though i didn't used it as i mounted LED on the wall.
No Support for Amazon Prime Video
WiFi Disconnection issue even after update
Wifi connection is not reliable and TV hang sometime

Overall product is worth its price.",4.0

It was a good experience to shop with Amazon. As usual, Amazon was very prompt in its delivery service ( Though the delivery date made me wait for long).

Thank you Amazon for an extremely lovable deal. Wish to shop with you with such more deals. Tons of thanks!!

About TV:

After two days of usage, I'm happy with performance of the TV.

The picture and sound quality is certainly upto the mark.

After few months, I would certainly review the TV once again.

The smart features are quite good. So is the case with the voice recognition facility. It's my first android TV and I'm satisfied with its performance.

Cons:

The demo service was not upto the mark. The technician was considerably negligent about the various features of the TV. I requested for the knowledgeable technician to visit but a teenager looking person was sent. I'd have been happy to know about the features for the expert.",4.0
664,"Hi, I am a big fan of Xiomi products. They always worked perfactly.

But i am not happy with my recent purchase of Mi 4C pro TV. The TV is good but there is so much to improve in software part.

1. There is no auto AV select on boot option. There are older members in our family and they are not able to handle new OS like interface and they just want to watch good old Set Top Box Channels. It was a simple option in previous version of MI TV 4A so why it is not available in this one?

Temporary Solution :- You can select Live TV app in TV and set it as the first app in home screen. So whenever you tv starts it will be the first app selected by default and by pressing select (big middle round button) Set Top Box will start.

2. There is no instant TV on option. It is available in other same category android tv. After shutting down we have to wait for the whole OS to load again.

3. I bought MI IR cable and it is detected by Live TV Guide app in main screen but whenever i select a channel it says the cable is not connected. I have tried resetting the TV and still not working. It was working fine in previous tv why is it not working in this one. Please help.

3. Why can't i use the built in bluetooth as a regular normal bluetooth like sending files and more. When android is available there in tv and we are paying for it why not let us use it at its full potential.

4. It's a android TV and no time is displayed on home screen.

I have always liked Mi for its full support for the customers. I hope they will come up with solutions and release an update as soon as possible.",4.0
665,"Bought it for 12999 a year ago, Now in India every electronic goods rate increased so don't expect for the same price now.

667,"I bought this as a second TV for my bedroom and now I am repenting why I did not buy bigger size TV. Got it as an exchange for my 10 year old LG TV and with credit card discount at 11k.
Pros :
1. Patch wall , although has old collection, is a clear differentiator compared to other 32 inch non smart TVs from LG, Samsung and Sony. It has lot of regional content and is improving. Agreed that it is SDish ; but still is good. My old fire TV stick works with the only exception that for Netflix, audio needs to be set back to stereo as 5.1 output does not work.
2. Inspite of being just HD ready, HD content looks good (but not as great as my old LG HD ready)

Cons:
1. Sound is loud but audio clarity is not good. Looks like outpur is bass heavy which makes the dialogues less clear at high volume.
2. Not rugged like LG and Sony. Handle with care if you plan to shift homes. Very delicate.
3. 32 inch looks puny. Go for 43 and Full HD.
4. No Alexa integration. Being an android TV, it is easy to give this feature.",4.0
668,I already have a 43 inch Sony Bravia whivh i m using gor last 5 yrs..last month I bought 43 inch MI tv.If i can compare both the products there are lots of difference in terms of internet connectivity..picture quality and sound quality.But in reality if i can comparing yhe price its even hell n heaven difference.My sony Bravia was costing around 60K where as this TV cost me around 23k.Overall this is a nice product and worth buying.There are certain video format which is not supported by this TV and you need to connect to the internet multiple yimes(atleast once per day).Finally i eould say..Go for it.,4.0
669,"Pros
Smart TV( You can watch YouTube)
Voice command operated search ( you can search youtube content with your voice. No need to type words)
LED HD ready tv.
32 inches is enough for a medium-sized room or halls.
Wall mountable and table top.
Lightweight.
High-quality picture display.
Colour and contrast are excellent at this price.
HDMI ports are inbuilt. so you can connect your HD set-top box, Computer, HD cam, DTH set-top box etc.
Inbuilt chromecast device. You can watch movies or mobile content through your android mobile with the help of Wifi router.
Low priced high quality and more featured Tv
Cons
Unable to third-party apps
unable to download more apps from the android play store.
remote is not user-friendly.
Patchwall software dominates Android.
Amazon prime video app not included.
The wall mount is not included in the package. If you want to fix the tv to the wall, you have to purchase separately.

But Overall product is the best at this price range.",4.0
670,"Pros:
1. Value for money
2. Patchwall - subjective choice but I like it
3. Remote - simply works
4. Picture quality - quite decent for the money paid

Cons:
1. Wouldn't connect to WiFi if router was more than 8-10 ft away from TV. Even called customer support to see if I could fix it. Finally, had to move the router to a height of about 8ft and within 6ft (around a wall, though) to make it work
2. Sound output will NOT make you dance with joy
3. HD ready and not Full HD - expecting too much

Installation:
It is outsourced - they did not have one screw so they installed it without that. Wall mounted with a swivel setup. Pretty ordinary service.",4.0
671,"This set is a primarly Android TV and secondary cable/DTH. What I mean is, unlike other smart TVs which defaults to HDMA or cable/dish TV, this switches on to home page / android. Everytime you switch on the TV, you have to select HDMA to watch cable/dish which I feel a nusense. For my other VU and LG smart TVs, when I power on, Tatasky comes up without any effort. In this TV, first you have to use the Mi remote to power on the TV, then select HDMA, then pickup Tatasky remote to proceed further.

And every time you power on, it takes nearly minute, as android needs to boot up.

Another caution: Mi remote is of bluetooth technology, so it cannot be paired with your Tatasky or any DTH remote which work with infra red technology. The ease of one remote for TV and set top box is gone.

If elders or parents or lesser techie person wants a TV, please dont go for this due to lesser ease of operation.",4.0

But the issue is with connectivity - you are not able to cast your phone with TV. Connecting Bluetooth speaker is also lengthy process.

For any kind of setting, you have to come out at home page then can perform any settings.

One of the Most important topic for this TV. I have seen many people are complaining about the installation but trust me the installation team is very professional. They have given proper demo and clearly detailed about merits and demerits of this product.
Now the performance, till now it seems like a great device.

4 star out of 5",4.0
675,"First impressions:

Great smart device but low picture quality so can't call it a smart TV can call it a smart device

Update: After 5 days of usage

Thought it is a great smart device
But after usage a few days found many problems namely

1. WiFi needs to be conected manually Everytime you switch on the tv
Intially thought WiFi wasn't in range and I have purchased range extender as tv showing low signal strength and the router getting constantly disconnected even though WiFi router was in the adjacent room with only one wall in-between
When I was setting up the range extender I found strength of WiFi signal at the tv is 80% later checked with the mobile and laptop and confirmed it.
As anyway I have purchased the range extender, went ahead and installed it just beside tv. Now tv doesn't get disconnected in the middle but I have to manually connect to WiFi every time I switch on the tv.
Implies poor WiFi antenna in TV

2.its not a smart device we need a teche to install apps and make tv smart

3. PATCHWALL worst thing I have ever seen
It doesn't have any content it its own. It is the app which shows the content of various apps such as ZEE5, voot, hungama play, sunNXT, H&Q, EROS NOW, EPIC ON, ...
To view content each of these apps need to be individually installed and have individual subscription as normal user of the apps with no additional discount, on top of it we can't access these apps natively on Android home nor install them there.

Update

Amazon prime and Netflix working
Apps are installing outside patchwall
Overall good after Android 9 update
3.5 star 4 is little optimistic",4.0
676,"I was using Mi Led TV 4A from last 6-7 months. I bought this Mi led TV 4C Pro one week ago.

Talk about build quality it's made by plastic & good enough at this price point. It's light weight & design is almost similar to Mi LED TV 4A.

Picture quality is not the very best but it's good. Resolution is 1366×768 means it is only a HD ready panel. I checked on tv upto 4k videos on YouTube & full hd videos on USB drive was playing smoothly but after 720p no major difference in quality of video on higher resolution. I feel little bit better quality display in comparison of Mi LED TV 4A. One thing to notice on display that corners are little but darker when your screen is white. Overall picture quality is acceptable.

Sound output is almost same as Mi Led TV 4A. It comes with 10w×2 two speakers setup & it is loud & clear upto 70% volume. I feel little bit distortion on high volume but I say it is one the best the sound output in TVs in this price segment.

Now talk software/os it runs on Android 8.1 & Patchwall. Android gives you freedom to download tons of apps from play store which is already available on tv. You can set up your android smartphone with tv. Share your smartphone content to tv easily through Google cast because it comes with Chromecast built in. Youtube works flawlessly if internet speed is good. Patchwall gives lots of content from many online content partners some are free and some paid but it's good.

Tv comes with lots of connectivity features. Here is 3×HDMI, 2×USB, AV, 3.5mm audio out, lan port, Bluetooth & wifi.
Tv comes with a bluetooth enabled 12 button voice remote which is very useful you can use is from any direction & use voice command from dedicated mic available on remote.

Table mount comes in box but you need to pay 399 for wall mount installation.

2) Good in speed and Bluetooth connectivity I connected my Bluetooth speakers, headphones and it's working fine.

678,"MI has done a great job in marketing the fully featured Android TV which is originally manufactured by TCL. But the marketing and customer service after sales by MI provides assurance although this is a very affordabe low entry priced TV in Android market.

The setup of this fully featured Android TV is simple and effective and the pre installed apps works flawlessly. Although the video playback through wifi and chromecast even in high speed network had some playback issues in downloaded apps which is negligible if u dont install too many apps.

The best part of this MI TV is the remote which is simple and best for Internet TV users. Since its an Android based TV most people who buy this would essentially use more of the Internet content hence this remote which is simliar to Amazon Fire TV Stick is absolutely wonderful.

The only thing that needs some improvement is the Sound quality. No doubt that the speakers are loud but the voice clarity is not that clear having used to the other TV brands which cost thrice as much as this MI Android TV. For a start to start using Android fearures in a TV that too in this price segment its easily the best Android TV in the market current if u are willing to spend some money on a quality sound bar for better quality sound.

Bought it at a price of Rs. 12,499 without the instant discount on card payment. But if Rs. 1500 is reduced the price of Rs. 10,999 is an absoutele delight for every person who decides to but this TV with all those interesting features provided which works best as promised. Overall a must buy if u are looking for a secondary Android TV or if u are new to the android world. Sure no one would regret for the money paid thanks to Amazon and MI for coming up with this awesome product!",4.0
679,"Observations :
- Booting the device takes similar time like booting a android smartphone. It's not plug and play like normal TV's. I myself have LG smart TV and good part about that is it boots up fast and plays the channel from DTH and loads the android festures later. We generally use TV for watching channels and not for browsing through various apps. Here even shutting down takes some time.
- No channel selector buttons or mouse feature in remote like LG smart TV. In LG I can either use DTH remote or TV remote for changing channels , volume etc. But here once we swtich on the TV we have to take DTH remote to switch on DTH and change channel
- Also once TV boots up, everytime we have to manually select setup box from the menu which is cumbersome process especially when you are gifting this product to elderly people.
- The picture quality is average and when comparing with LG , picture is not that great.
- Bluetooth feature of remote is quite good as we no longer need to show remote directly to the TV
- OS is pretty good and is very fast unlike LG webos. Because the processor and RAM is higher than LG. Otherwise LG webOS has much more features.
- TV is sleek and has more input and output ports
-viewing angle is average
- Screen mirroring is very laggy and causes strain to eye. LG webOS has upper hand here.
- Google speech works very very well. It understands indian accent very well",4.0
680,"Very good android tv at the price.
No other option in market can beat this quality and features.
Pros:
Voice Recognition is too good to use
Build Quality is very good
Sound quality is good at this price and I'm surprised by this
Certified Android TV
Navigation is easy with remote provided, even remote control is quite good and very simple and clutter free
Connectivity is very easy and fast
Enough HDMI/USB slots
Cons:
Hangs a lot when using any installed app
Too slow to respond at times, 1GB Ram is not enough. Think of future say after 4-5 years this TV won't even turn-on with this configuration.
Patchwall is of no use and all the content either paid or unwatchable. Let buyers decide whether they want amazon prime, netfix, zee5, hungama whatever they can install. Don't bloat. I request Xiaomi to remove the patchwall to make some space and reduce lag.
No wall mount stand provided. It's ok if Xiaomi doesn't provide wall mount in package but the wall mount installation guys provide is fixed and non movable. So its of no use. Al least they can provide option fot flexible wall mount.
Picture quality is not that great with narrow viewing angles. I have to run it on full brightness always to watch anything on this tv.

Video and audio quality is really good.
It is 720 video, works fine with 1080p videos also in vlc player.
Just con of tv is its PLAY STORE.
when i purchased it, MI people said, that NETFLIX and AMAZON PRIME will come in January 2019 update, but its june 2019, still no app, not much apps on playstore, though u can use aptoide and air remote, to use amazon prime and netflix.
You can google what aptoide is.
If you are planning to purchase decent 32INCH android tv, this is the one in this price.
Voice recognition works pretty fine for me. Almost all app support that feature.
Just install aptoid in it, and its the best tv
Just need official amazon and netflix app, these apps lags when downloaded from third party.",4.0
682,"I will tell you everything you need to know just read carefully it will save your money.
It has average 720p picture quality. And
Above average sound quality.
I purchased it 12500 on sale and now its gonna cost you 16000. Now dont make the mistake buying it at 16000 you probably gonna blame yourself after that.
I had broadband connection of 50 mbps so i can play 4k videos without buffering. I installed live tv apps it save me 500 every month for hd pack on dth thats why i purchased this smart tv at 12500.
And if you are going to buy this tv now dont go for it because it has 720p screen and when you use it with normal dth pack it will give very bad picture quality and also you should not go for it at 16000 because at approx 17500 you can easily purchase a 1080p tv that will give you better result
Even with normal dth pack in comparision with mi tv 4c pro. And if you need smart features just buy amazon fire tv stick it will cost you approx 3000 on sale. It will going to be your best option buy any 1080p non smart tv with amazon fire tv stick. There is another important point i want to tell you if you go with any smart tv its processing is going to be slowing and laggy by the time but non smart tv gonna last you more than 10 years easily and also if you are using fire stick its also gonna slow down by the time like smart tv but fire stick just cost 3000 replace it with new and your non smart tv is going to work like a champ..",4.0

For mobile use Google home application Which supports Chromecast works great.

Pros:-
Good screen quality though HD ready
Good viewing angles almost 180 deg
Google voice assistant
Jio tv works great
Google play store
Loud sound
Good synching of online and on air contents
Cons:-
-Cheap quality plastic(delicate to use)
-When using TV speaker, outside speaker needs to be disconnected
-Google play store too have limited apps for android tv better to use aptoide
-patchwall interface is very bad as compared to amazon firestick it has got premium interface
-it looks that Mi has launched it in hurry without working on its os
-most of the contents are paid
-black colors not sharp, may look for VU smart tv which has A+ grade panels.",4.0

695,"I'm not a big fan of MI, but this product with the offerings and pricing really attracted me. I just wanted a functional screen to connect my PlayStation to.

Picture Quality is moderate if you grew up watching Sony TVs. The screen isn't very bright but it does the job. For normal TV viewing, it works fine but takes a hit when it comes to gaming.

Sound quality is amazing! 5 stars for that. The TV is both loud and clear.

Chromecast- It's inbuilt. Works fine! But still a little shaky. Not the best Chromecast available. Streaming apps like hotstar are affected. Sometimes it won't cast. It just pauses the entire thing.

WiFi connectivity is very poor. MI support would ask you to reset it again and again. But that really doesn't solve a hardware problem.

For those of you who are looking for a Smart TV, this TV will not give you Netflix and Amazon Prime apps. Since I have a PlayStation so it isn't a problem for me.
However, you get Google Play store. Not many apps but would do.

The viewing angle isn't that great on this. Overall, this is a decent tv with a lot of features. But these features could use a little work and I'm hoping it would get better with newer versions.

The service person will insist you to buy the tv mount from them, but we can get tv mounts at half the price from amazon. Also, mind he will charge 30 rs for the small AAA size battery to be inserted in the smart remote, thats way more costlier than normal.

In regards to TV< awesome picture quality, and ease of navigation.

700,"You buy cheap and cheap is what you get. No complaints for what I got for the price I paid
Switching from a 7 year old Sony 21"" to a Mi TV 43"", the change in both picture and audio quality is not just noticeable, it is in your face.
I mean the audio sounds cheap and tinny. Even my JBL Bluetooth sounds better.
The image quality is just about suffer-able. Also if you are used to 1080p displays like on your phone, laptop, TV with much smaller screens, FHD on 43"" will give you a terrible experience especially with this TV that does ZERO anti-aliasing.I cant get past those pixel corners that are so clearly visible. If you don't understand what I am saying, look at the curve of 'M' in Mi when the TV boots up.
Before buying this TV i had read many review which mentioned losing WiFi connectivity or apps crashing when streaming full HD content. I myself noticed the same in one of my office TVs and attributed it to poor WiFi strength. But with this TV i can confirm that it is not the WiFi, I have a nighthawk gigabit router sitting less than 5 feet from the TV. When I connect the TV to ethernet, I dont see any more youtube crashes. So the wifi card in the TV is trashy cheap too and unable to handle heavy traffic.
Boot-up time of the OS is not impressive either and takes ~60 seconds

Now for the good parts.
Installation and configuration was super easy. In fact I did it myself in ~15 mins. My grandma looked like she could do it as well.
There is a general setting which lets you remember the last used input source. So you can use it an a dumb display with your set-top box or radio frequency TV cable. In my case I found it much more convenient to use my Jio set top box to stream online content in full HD (primevideo, youtube) than using Mi's android tv or patchwall

The image quality may be forgiven if you pair the TV with good home-theater audio, otherwise this TV is suitable for 1000 rs per night hotel rooms",3.0

Amazon's delivery and installation was fast. I had no problems with that. However, I realised it the hard way that Chinese products are always sub standard. They have lower prices for their product to compensate for their sub standard quality. Here's why I say so. First of all, the bluetooth remote is basically a bomb that can explode in your hand. Problems developed after a month of using the remote. First it stopped working, I changed the batteries and it started working. Within a week the batteries drained out. I brought new batteries and again the same result. I again brought new batteries and the remote became so hot that it started smoking. Now a new remote has to be purchased from MI store. Second the picture quality is not upto the mark. HD channels clarity is way lower than a similar Sony or LG or Samsung product. The contrast colours stand out too bright. The TV has 2 10w speakers. At max volume the sound is too wierd. I didn't have a satisfactory experience with Mi. Though it's a budget TV, it will not give the satisfaction for that budget.",3.0

Booting takes a lot of time. Almost 40 to 50 seconds. When the power is on tv always starts with patch wall home screen. Then you have to manually select the input or live tv.

Old TVs had basic buttons and limited functions so could do most of the tasks from TV buttons as well but still those TVs also had lot of buttons on remote whereas smart TV has lot of features and remote is the only tool you have to control it. MI remote doesn't have Mute button so forget about other functions.
Oh and it takes ages typing with this remote. You better buy 2in1 remote online which has both touch and keyboard features.
Really, you will have to spend lot of time to do normal things with this TV and remote.
There are 2 modes to access channels/apps. TV interface is hard to manage, you can customize little bit on app interface but it is almost impossible to make the changes in Patchwall. I tried watching videos but that does not help. You are stuck with the random serials/movies/channels on tabs on Patchwall.
I'm using wi-fi with good speed so streaming was ok but TV LAGS SEVERAL TIMES, you have to clear cache and everything. Voice assistant response is also SLOW now.
You can boost and clear cache from inbuilt TV manager app but still I'm not happy, you can take a chance.

Display is nice, no complaints about that.
Sound is also good for this price.

710,"Bought the TV and went onto the MI website to register the Installation. The request noted and Technician sent the same day.
The Technician called before coming and said he is coming with a wall mount, I told him, I did not want it. When he came, he started telling me, it is best to install with a wall mount. I insisted on the table mount. He then asked me to use a Voltage Stailizer, I refused stating that, MI has said there is no need. He tried again, agressively to sell me the Voltage stabilizer saying, that this is a LED Tv, so it would be better to fit the VS. I point blank told him NO and told him not to force his items on me.
He then proceeded and installed the Tv, telling me breifly, the different options available, but no actual hands on way was tried. He then took a foto of me in front of the Tv, asking me to give him a rating. I gave him 5, because he was knowledgeable, as far the Installation was concerned.
Then he asked me to sign 2 papers which were blank. He said, he would fill them later. One of them was a Request for a Wall Mount. I told him, this was not right, as I didnt need it. But, I signed, it saying that ONLY THE TABLE MOUNT WAS INSTALLED.
These are ways, the Agents are trying to fleece the Public. Please take care. He would not agressively do this, if his agency did not subscribe to it.
The next day, there was a feedback call from the Agency, and I told them that the Installation was fine, but the attitude to force items on a customer was not. I also told them, that I would put it in my review.
I further told them, i was having some trouble, getting into grips with the system, as the Technician had only given me a gist of it. They said, they would send him again, but, no one has come.

cons:
1. Bit of an average display quality (less pixel density)

718,"Mixed experience! did a lot of research before finalising on this TV
Reasons I went with this buy
1. Android TV is coming up (again) and TV market is fast evolving, spending 30-40k on a Sony/Samsung as a 5yr investment did not feel right, (this TV could be a temp investment and can upgrade in a couple of years when there are more clearer options)
2. Players like Vu, bpl, sanyo are known for their super bad after sales support; didn't want to take that risk considering MI is marginally better and promising a lot in the service front
3. Even as a standalone tv ignoring the 'smart' aspect, it still is decent value for money at 14k (after 1k cash back)
4. 1yr extended warranty is one more reason to buy now

Pros
1. Good picture quality for hd ready (comparable to Sony hd ready) though longevity is a question
2. Speakers are good enough for a mid-sized living room
3. Looks good!
4. Seamless Google account integration

Cons
1. Chromecast works only partially - not all apps that support Chromecast cast in this TV, example Netflix
2. Play Store is a joke - hardly 10 apps that are useful available right now and Netflix, Prime, Sony Liv are definitely not on the list

Verdict - if you are ready to invest in fire stick (or if you are a fan of PatchWall) then this TV is a decent value for money. Hopefully more apps and features come onboard in this 'android tv'",3.0

Pros:
Usually I try to be positive about things but in this case the cons overpower the pros if any.
Buy a conventional smart TV and then buy Tata Sky binge or separate Android box if you can, I think that would work well.

Cons:
1. TV is super slow, it has very low amount of internal memory and even with external pen drive to expand the memory the starting time and opening of any app is super slow.
2. Many a times the OTT streaming apps crashes.
3. If you are watching a movie with the scene in dark and the room is well lit, you will only see black screen.
4. After 2years 3 months of use now the led seems to have gone bad, please see the attached picture, with vertical black lines.
5. Voice command on the remote is slightly better than useless.
6. If you plan to watch something while having food in front of the TV, chances are that you will finish eating with TV remote in one hand and TV still hung and non responding.

721,"To start with there are thousands of reviews for the Mi TV, some good and some bad. My review is after using it for a week and I would rate the TV as Average. Like a 7 out of 10.

Main reasons:

1. Display quality is average - the blacks are not purely black, the colour suffers a little.

2. WiFi - there are some serious issues with the TV when connected to WiFi, while watching Netflix or youtube, the video plays for some time and then it starts buffering, sort of just gets hung. This can be resolved by using LAN wire instead. Works fine when connected via LAN.

My rating keeping in mind what you are getting for the price:

Audio - 7/10
Picture - 7/10
Smart features - 8/10
WiFi connectivity - 2/10

Where to buy -

Would recommend buying directly from MI website if you want additional warranty at a small cost. Else, go for amazon if you want the option of 10 day replacement incase you face any issues with the TV.",3.0

723,"not as good as mi mobiles cannot cast mobile screen unless i have onother 2nd mobile for hotspot including my own one you need to mobiles cannot use fb whtsapp cannot use real playstore as other lg smsung and desi companies provide , only slectable application can fownload wich can not be good , youtube runs only in 140 p quality can not adujuct the quality of youtube yourself it will run but tv automatically what it want , worse past it cannot change video qaulity it run auto mode by tv cant change as usualy we don in other tv youtube app ,",3.0
724,"This is a OK product.
It's basically a bad product, but if you consider the price then you can somewhat justify it.
First of all cons are:
1. The screen quality isn't good. The back-lighting is very bad and uneven.
2. Picture quality and colour reproduction isn't good.
Most people buy a TV for watching contents but when the panel and picture quality, two of the most important factors aren't good enough, you can't call it a good product.

Pros:
1. The sound is very good.
2. Nice design.
3. It runs on Android, it's a huge bonus, and till date I didn't have any lagging issues.

- Overall considering the price it's not bad but not good either.",3.0
725,"Definitely happy with the product but not happy with mi's customer centric thoughts. Mi won't ship wall mounts with the TVs. Installation technicians charge 1100 to 2000 for the wall mounts. But the irony is, Mi sells the wall mount separately for 500 in its official website. Mi must consider including wall mounts inside TV box to avoid installation persons looting customers.",3.0
726,"TV is good, no doubt but I have doubts and my rating depends on those doubts, if these doubts are cleared, my rating will be different. I had ordered for MI LED 4C Pro and after installation, when I updated software, it generated Build number as OPM1.171019.011.1010 which is applicable for MI LED TV 4A Pro so plz. clear my doubt, my tv is 4A Pro or 4C Pro which was originally ordered.",3.0
727,"Product quality is bad my 2012 Samsung TV have better build an picture quality. Giving 3 star just for the price range.

Gap between panel and boders. Remote sensitivity is not good as we need to point it in a specific direction to work. TV hangs in between switching application and video. I watched India England cricket match on on this and screen refresh rate is very bad as ball leave the trails in HD viewing.",3.0
728,Value for money,3.0
729,"Good tv . There is a slight lag when the tv switches on but apart from that it works fine.
Picture quality is ok but to be fair didnt expect a lot at this price.
Volume is decent for a small room , wont require external speakers unless you want bass . Bluetooth feature does let you connect your headphones and speakers

Overall quality is good for the price",3.0
730,"Cons:
The SD setup box upscaling is not as good as i expected. SD setup box doesnt look good
The panel has whitish fading from side viewing
720p makes for blurry menu text and overall the whole tv is blur even when connected to 1080p internet or video

pro:
Android is fun
customizable
can do so many things
Dielevery and installation was quick

At 11k lot of fun but for future use Buy 4k 43 inch",3.0
731,"Pros- good hd display.
Smart features at less price below 10k.
Cons- voice quality poor.
Voice going up and down all the time. You will have to keep remote in your hand to reduce and increase sound, to hear conversation and to save your ear from loud background music .
Previously I was using LG, now I realize in sound quality LG is best.
Hope mi will upgrade song software.",3.0
732,"The screen is very dull as you can see in the picture I've posted.

Picture quality is good but screen is not bright enough.

No official Netflix app and netflix google/chrome cast doesn't work. Side loaded app works but needs a mouse. I've installed version 4.16.1 build 200147.

It's an OK product but if you compare the price it's the best you can get.",3.0
733,"Using since 1-2 months. Satisfied with the physical TV, interface, picture quality etc.

However be aware of its serious compatibility issues. In short - apps aligned to MI/Android such as Hotstar, ZEE5 etc. work well. Apps not aligned to it such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV are a struggle:

1. These apps are not pre-installed which is not an issue, but they are also not available on the TV's Google Play Store
2. You therefore have to install them through a process involving a USB stick which again is something I can easily live with - but then they do not function properly. Netflix works but the navigation is slightly sub-par. Prime Video worked for a few weeks now it just hangs, have reinstalled and tried every other fix but it does not work on my TV anymore. Airtel TV is displayed inverted on my TV, not been to fix it no matter what
3. I also feel seriously cheated by the in-built chromecast. In my previous home I used to have an external chromecast device to which I was able to cast Netflix, Prime Video and othe apps from my Apple devices without any hitch whatsoever. You cant do that with MI TV's in-built chromecast - for many apps the cast does not connect at all, for others it casts with a poor picture quality. This has been confirmed to me as normal by MI TV's customer care

Overall if you are looking to use the TV for apps such as Netflix, Prime Video, Airtel TV (and maybe more) I do not think this is the right TV - you will have interface, connectivity and compatibility issues. I feel cheated because I bought this TV among others in this budget for its in-built chromecast and similar features. MI TV now tells me that since these are compatibility issues and not defects I just have to live with them :(",3.0
734,"Actually, I wouldn't say that Amazon is cheating... However the product is not upto the mark the way it is being advertised

1. Picture quality is very poor, infact i would not consider it as an HD TV. I have compared it with my old TV i bought 8 years ago. That old tv has better display... Somewhat i feel i got cheated on the display quality by MI
2. Sound is just fine.
3. Voice control is fine, but that remote without regular button takes lot of time to switch over to chennal/program
4. Installation was on time. No complaints from Amazon
I would suggest the customer before buying it go to the local market check the picture quality then buy from Amazon",3.0
735,"Giving this review after use if for 6 months now. It AVERAGE product overall.

Pro :
1. price range

Cons :
1. Voice recognition is pathetic. Stops in between.
2. Voice quality is not effective. Sometime even on full volume its not tht much of clear.
3. Become too slow to operate in between. Seems hanged.",3.0
736,"People who came for the installation were dumb and idiots. They firstly charged Rs. 400 for the TV wall bracket which was not informed earlier. Secondly they turned off and messed up my Tata Sky set up connection.
I would suggest the company to send some thorough professionals for installation and not these idiots.

TV has been installed today so can't really say about anything about it right now.",3.0
737,"Play Video
 TV is just ok. Remote has only few button to use. Some how we are facing issue with dth setup. Most of time picture gets extra larged as shown in the video ane sometimes complete black, so we need to restart the tv every time. Not completely satisfied with the TV.",3.0

If not having WiFi network better not buy this.",3.0
740,"Mirroring is also not happening with HD Videos and app like Airtel etc.
I am very upset with this, Android is not supporting all app in Mobile during Mirroring.

Its Good to Buy who are not using Android, Simple but Interested in Android then waste of money spending here.",3.0
741,"Picture quality is good
Sound very bad not clear
but my problem is only with connectivity issues you can't connect your mobile without same WiFi this is to bad I want cast my mobile to TV then also switch other hotspot to connect both TV and mobile which you want to cast on TV
After update sounds is good but one problem plz fix screen cast and mirroring without same WiFi connection.",3.0
742,"Over all Product is good. But request to all of you, please don't buy this or such type of product unless and until you aware all the features, because if you are not satisfied about the features and want to return the product then amazon not accept your return request. Although if you are call to customer care for return request, they will not entertain you.
The bad thing about this product is, it takes so much time to start, and you can't set AV1, or HDMI as default start option , We want this feature, so that user can see TV via AV1 port when turn on the TV",3.0
743,"MRP on box was ₹26k and amazon showed 30kcut ₹27k so i tweeted and got a ₹1k refund, please do check it on box on delivery and fight.
I still like my 8yr old sony display, it's colours are much more natural than this, colours are boosted too much here.",3.0
744,The picture is good but the sound through the Samsung sound bar is very low. Also the instruction/user manual is not given. So we cannot alter the sound settings,3.0

Mirror casting to tv without internet update Received now we will connect phone to tv without internet but its dropping the connection while you watch something, need to fix that bug

Disliked.... every time on start up & on power off taking to much time..",3.0
746,"I purchased the TV in Oct 2019. I had a Vu 43' TV earlier, and use a Sony Hometheatre for better sound.

The Mi TV is so poor with its sound output, that despite choosing the upper levels of volume on TV & HT, the sounds arent clear in a decent sized hall itself. Very unhappy with this element alone.

All other features like Patchwall, picture clarity, build etc are just fine for the price range",3.0
747,"Play Video
 Clarity was really good. Smart Tv changing one app to another is really slow it required some buffer time to load the page.
Ram need to be increased for online connectivty.",3.0
748,I bought this tv like 4 5 months ago. the first tv I received was a disaster it used to automatically turn off. later hell amount of contacting customer care and local customer care they finally gave me new tv. but be aware of local customer care people they try to make money from you which is completely unnecessary,3.0
749,"1. Chromecast was not working on TV.
2. Also after 3 days wifi was getting connected but it was showing ""no internet"", while internet was working on other devices
3. On connecting hotspot thru mob, it was showing ""data saver on""...but even on clicking on off option it was not turning off

Above problems were resolved after factory reset of TV and again setting up TV. However this is not acceptable in a smart TV but considering cheap cost of TV it's understandable.",3.0
750,"Strongly do not recommend this TV.

SMART TV Features - NO Netflix, NO Amazon Prime Video. Even using inbuilt Chromecast, we CANNOT cast from Netflix / Amazon Prime Video mobile apps - DISGUSTING.

DISPLAY - Absolutely worst display. There are bright spots at random locations on the screen, the picture clarity is also very bad. Colors are not accurate too. THIS IS NOT a A+ grade panel.

SOUND - Worst sound output ever i have seen on a TV. Sound is distorted and not audible CLEARLY. Can't even hear the words properly. Must be some cheap Chinese speakers.

Not many useful apps in the google play store. A big let down.

Did a BIG MISTAKE by buying this TV. Totally REGRET it. Suggest you to go for A+ panel displays. This is no Smart TV with missing netflix and prime video apps inbuilt. All the other stupid apps like hungama, etc, we need to signup which is a headache.

My sincere suggestion - DO NOT BUY MI TVs. They are worst than MICROMAX Tvs. Total waste of money buying this Mi TV.",2.0
751,"I bought it in the name of smart tv and cheap price. I'm disappointed with majorly two points:

1. Poor picture quality. I had Full HD connection. And, the quality is superb on my another TV (Samsung smart tv). But, the quality is so bad that I confirmed from my provider whether the connection is running on HD!

2. There is no Amazon Prime, Netflix App support in app. And, they are promoting their shitty patchwall app.

This TV is good for people experiencing their first smart tv and that too in tight budget.
Else, dont go for this TV. Samsung is best in this business.",2.0
752,"First of all 1 star for delivery.
Paid extra amount for next day delivery but product delivered after 2 days.
(Tip: Don't pay extra for fast delivery option specially on Great Indian Festival)

For installation and demo 5 star.

Coming to TV,
TV is smart with android os but display is average.

Display- 3/5
Sound- 4/5

Display looks more brighter.
There are no options to change colour settings, only brightness and contrast can be changed.

Looking for smart tv around 14k then look for it.
But have extra budget and want better display go for other options.

Will update about smart features after few days of use.

Thank you",2.0
753,"1)After 10 days, Google assistant not responding (Remote Google assistant button) even though you're connected to internet
2) Picture quality not good when you use Cable and Non HD plans
3)We cannot download all the apps from Google play.There are limitations
4) Google cast not good. When you play a movie through Google cast or mirror cast ,
There is a lot of lagging.
5)If you have mounted your TV on wall, it is difficult to connect a USB or any another devices.For that you have to buy a extension cable.
6)you cannot change the TV channels through the TV remote.You have to buy IR cable to make it functional(for DTH ).
7) Out of 8 gb you will get 3 to 4gb internal memory
8)Table mount stands are not good
9)For wall mount you have to pay 400 rupees extra",2.0

1- Lesser Price
2- Android Tv

Cons:

2- Dull colors
3- Sound is just average no bass and when you volume up more than 50% speaker randomly going up and down
4- Worst service & customer support
5- Google voice search button is a hit and miss have to press even 3 times sometime.",2.0
755,Netflix is not support by both MI android tv app and its inbuilt chrome cast. Highly disappointed with it. Called MI customer care and they said that it won’t support. This is very basic feature of any smart tv and should be declared before selling it.,2.0
756,"I bought this TV a year ago ...The startup of the TV very slow probably you could finish up a cup of Tea or finish a short snack...Pathetic MI . The connection to the WiFi is also slow.There is no mute button in the remote you have to take care of the remote like a 2month baby as the plastics are very cheap and the battery compartment cover is very fragile (Now I've taped it to keep it intact) and the buttons response to the TV slow. The smart features are to fool you.You can't install more than 4 apps. YouTube logs out automatically while watching and you will never know when. But at this price point you need to sacrifice the above hurdles ....Think before buying it... a light user can go for it...For heavy screen time I wouldn't recommend this product go for some brands like Samsung,Sony or Lg. Coming to the audio if yu r watching a mastered sound ...The wshhh & Wooo sound will be there and will be irritating...Normal HD quality audio will suite the viewers and the advertised 20W speaker is just a Gimmick. As far as the picture it's just ok for normal use.",2.0
757,"MI is really a useless company. They have launched this TV but its remote doesn't switchon the TV, evertime you have to go near tv to switch it on with button given underneath. The technician says the company has not launched the upgrade for remote. It really sounds stupid on MI's part. So far in last 3months of usage i have to call once the technician for service as tv was not working due to software problem. In service center you have to give your billing details everytime you call as they don't have software to keep your call and billing record.",2.0

I was pissed off to know I can't download any app of my own choice.

And then, OS would crash, within a span of 1 month have reinstalled (factory reset) 4-5 times. Last nail in the coffin, remote stopped working, without which one cannot do much, stare at the home screen and screen saver after some time!.

Please purchase taking these points into consideration. It's cheaper than other successful brands but not trustable.

The interface: The Google TV interface is an absolute pain! Takes a while to boot and every task is time consuming. When the TV is switched on, the home screen opens by default. From there it is required to switch to the desired source.
The remote: There isn't a mute button on this remote! Are you kidding me, Xiaomi? Even the source cannot be switched, or the picture settings/brightness cannot be adjusted without going back to the Android home screen!

On the plus side, the picture quality isn't bad and Amazon music, Hotstar do work.

There were no visible breakage signs on screen but internally display was broken
When contacted Amazon for warranty they directed to mi support

778,"ABOUT THE PRODUCT:
Worst ever screen quality and color. The colors in display are washed away and looks like faded and washed. Dont go just behind the brand name ""MI"" bcoz still they r infant to tv market. My life's biggest mistake of buying this tv.

About sound its good.

Connectivity is good but if i insert pendrive and play movie, tv plays the movie by jumping from time...it cant play the usb contents flawlessly.

Regarding youtube connectivity, this tv cant play 1080p videos. Max resolution it can play is 720p. This is not at all fair.

About my return:

Worst return i have faced in my life with amazon. I placed return by oct 23,2018 and GATI COURIER was expected to pickup within 4 days but due to their laziness and lethargic, GATI COURIER picked the tv by oct 29,2018 at 9:30pm and given acknowledgement slip. The tracking number always shown no data found. I used to call amazon and gati but both of them did not gave positive response. Daily i used to struggle with customer care but those persons only tried to escape by giving fake assurances and cut the call. Then on Nov 7,2018 i called amazon 5 times and after the struggle, they initiated the refund. Approximately i have called amazon more than 30 times to just process refund initiation.

Finally amazon have to improve customer service and solve the issue of the customer before the stipulated time not after long time. And also amazon have to cut the service of GATI COURIER bcoz they spoil the amazon's name by their laziness.",2.0

780,"Mirroring experience is horrible. It takes too long to mirror your phone. Even you won't be sure if you could mirror it every time. Even if you manage to mirror it the connection gets disrupted frequently. Say, if you are mirroring a 2hr movie it gets disconnected atleast 3-4 times which is really annoying.

After a long mirroring session you'll face lagging on screen.

(It is important to mention that I am a hard-core friend of MI and I tried mirroring using note 4, note 5 Pro and 5a)

There is no one key navigation to TV mode or default TV mode. Everytime you switch on the TV you'll have to select the source. It is problematic specially if you have senior citizens in your family.

Finally the technician who came for the installation couldn't explain things properly citing that he had not been trained at all. So I'm worried whether they could provide proper service in future or not.",2.0

When enquired about this, the technician said ""Yes, all midrange TVs are made with goal that once repaired, the customer should not service it instead should buy new one and all the so-called affordable range TV brands manufacture their TVs with lifetime of 3-5yrs only"". Think of spending 15-20K for TV every 3-5yrs. Instead of this, buy from a well known brand for a bit higher budget.",2.0

2. We don't have autoplay mode for HDMI/AV that tunes to setup box which already available in 4A model
3. Amazon customer care was very much supportive to MI. They don't understand the problem and even criticizes issues that we are facing. I hope it not customer care it is provider care.",2.0

When it comes to screen quality.. it's not that great. Pretty average and grainy. But have to give points for a decent sound quality.

Installation guy came after 10 days and told us about the fault and asked us to return / repalce it. By that time. Replace window was closed. So after calling customer care 10 times , they returned it.

There is an option to factory reset but nothing is happening. Now have to give this to some customer care centre to get it fixed. When it works, it is real good. WHEN IT WORKS.

Update: I contacted Mi customer care yesterday and they were able to resolve the issue in no time. I was concerned that i had to take it to the service centres or send to back to Mi like we do for mobile replacement.

To my surprise i was told that THERE ARE NO SERVICE CENTRES CURRENTLY FOR Mi TV's. No service network at all. The customer care executive told me If the issue exists even after the fix is tried, i had to register for an installation request and then have the technician coming in for TV installation take a look at the TV to fix the issue.

805,"On papers the product looks good. However, when you start using it, issues will crop up in series. I am regretting buying this tv as it cannot be called a smart TV. They claim many things, but not everything work as expected.

1) Cannot connect it to wifi- WiFi connection keeps on dropping every minute. You can't use this tv as SMART TV. I raised a repair after struggling many days thinking that my internet connection is not strong. It took 6 days for them to come and check after I raised the request. The engineer said the problem is with my wifi router as TV is not compatible with TP Link router (which is absurd, why would you sell a tv which is not compatible with most used router brand) even though my other devices are working perfectly fine on the network. To that argument, i tried connecting TV to my phone hotspot. Connecting doesn't work in this case also. When i informed the engineer about this, he suggested me to connect tv to ethernet cable to use SMART features (in this case I cannot cast from any other device). The other issue is they are not trying to resolve the issue.

2) They claim it has Google play store. Honestly, it is useless. There are very few app which are usable. Even Netflix is not available.

3) You can't chrome cast all the apps. It support only limited set of apps. Cannot cast Netflix.

4) Patchwall which they advertise as its USP is actually useless. I never used it and i don't think anybody is using it to watch anything.

5) Very slow in opening apps and booting up.

810,"I have been purchasing multiple products over Amazon since its advent, sometimes even amounting to 1 lakh. I haven't reviewed a single item ever in my life. This time I am forced to.

A brief timeline:

A) Since this product was an Android TV at a steal price, I bought it, until realizing a big gaffe I had made.
B) I received the product on 28th October. I was told not to unbox it until MI support did so.
C) Mi support unboxes and wall mounts the TV on 31st. To both of our surprise, the remote is not present in the box.
D) As a guileless person who trusts values, I thought it of a minor mistake and raised a case with MI care. Even Mi installation guy raised a case internally.
E) After numerous followups (spending almost 2+hours), I was apprised on 1st Nov that ""as per internal investigation was done by MI, the package delivered to me was intact"".
F) I have been still following up with MI, and the TV is useless because it needs remote for the initial setup.

In a nutshell, we all believe MI products are great. The phones definitely are but cannot say exactly about TVs. I understand we all tend to buy amazing products at great deals. Everyone should.
But one needs to be careful of why still Samsung or Sony are finest. That is because they value their customers. It is all about ethics and principles. If MI cannot trust the integrity of its customers, then

1. Can wash everything from socks to curtains and sofa covers,rugs, bedsheets and everything comes out clean and dry.
2. Just put the clothes, fill liquid detergent and I complete all my housework while clothes are getting washed automatically.
3. There is soaking option also so in 75 minutes cycle all my clothes are soaked, washed, rinsed and dried. Makes life comfortable.
4. Even if electricity goes it doesn't matter as it starts from the same point when it was stopped.
5. Sometimes it happens I started the machineand come to my room and found a pair of socks that I forget to put..no problem..I just switch off the machine, open the lid and and put the socks inside and switch on the main switch again. No reprogramming required.
6. Only 1 thing sometimes the lint of other clothes gets deposited on woollens or jackets. So it's better to wash woollen clothes separately from daily wear. But it can be dusted off easily with a cloth brush after drying.
7. And most important the machine self cleans itself.
8. I purchased a long drain pipe separately as the drain pipe was too small. Now drain water is spilled out directly near the drain hole and my bathroom remains dry and clean.
9. Saves time, your hands and feet are soft as you don't need to put them in soap and water everyday for washing clothes. In one month my feet have become soft and pink.",5.0

OVERALL EXPERIENCE -

I Bought especially due to best seller product. Having perfect to my 4 member family. Weight is lightwright. Looking premium as compare to any others.

Ad per my opinion The brand trust is most important in such high range valuble things because whenever you required service it should be NEAR TO YOUR LOCATION as well as the parts availability and the service should be really important factor.
As per my view SAMSUNG have the capability to make trust from a long years with there service as compare to others as well as personally I really love there services as they treat with there customers.",5.0
852,"This top-loading washing machine is really easy to use. I bought it for my mother, who is used to a semi-automatic WM. I found that she is able to adapt and use it with ease. It takes a little more water compared to front-loading machines, but almost the same or maybe less than semi-automatic WM.
The overall washing perfomance is great.
I ordered the machine at 4PM, it got delivered the next morning at 8AM, at Durgapur (WB), I booked the free installation by calling the Samsung customer care. The engineer visited at 11AM, same day, and the machine was ready to use soon. I purchased a stand to keep the machine. I am really happy with the extremely prompt service of Amazon and Samsung customer support.
This is a great machine, blindly go for it.",5.0
853,We got this in the month of May '2021 initially I was skeptical about it but it is really nice the monsoon option is a.feature which really helps the clothes get almost dried which very helpful they had this facility extendedable pipe for atleast 10cm which was great as we could deattach and reattach whenevr it is necessary. Service installation as well is good he offered us a cover and a really good stand it was little costly but the stand was worth which is movable and adjustable. He gave the machine cleaner as well to clean the entire machine and keep it in good condition. When u compare with front load this doesn't give my much sound which is really good. Over Al it was an affordable and more options washing machine.,5.0

I installed it in my apartment by myself and it's an easy process.",5.0

The features of the machine is exactly what we're looking for.
We had problems with filters with our previous machine. Now, the filter here looks sturdy and well made. The diamond drum is made well. Hopefully the clothes will be washed properly without damages, in the future 😅

We can give a better review after using the washing machine for a few months.",5.0

The options are just enough for us to handle anything and everything we can imagine. The monsoon function is exceptionally useful and dried clothes very well. Clothes DO NOT entangle which is great too. Just start and forget. We are yet to use the delay feature, but it's a great option too. Delicate mode makes life easier.

863,"I brought the machine about 10 months ago and I have faced couple of issues but Samsung Care executives came home and checked the machine, apparently it was low pressure of water that was creating havoc.
I sorted that out with a mini pump that provides a better flow of water to the machine.

864,"This is the 3rd washing machine of this brand (Samsung) and model (WA65A4002VS/TL) that I have purchased. The machine is noiseless, easy-to-use and one of the bestsellers on all major online marketplaces. Samsung installation service is excellent, but please make sure the tap you're planning to connect to this machine has sufficient water pressure (and fix it beforehand, if not). It has 5 wash modes, but the 'Quick Wash' and 'Soak + Normal' modes are the ones you're most likely to use for day-to-day laundry. Highly recommended.",5.0
865,"Hello ,

I have been using this washing machine for around 3 months now.

Pros:

1. Clothes get cleaned satisfactorily
2. Almost noiseless
3. Very efficient and fast
4. Looks cute
5. All the essential functions are there including the powerful Monsoon dry function.

Cons:
1. None so far

If you are looking for a budget washing machine for 2-3 people, go blindly for it. There aren't many awesome machines at this range.

Until next time

One thing I notice is that it appears that there’s no way to clear the previous memory, just in case. All you need to do is hit Cycle button and previous options are cleared, if they are still present despite you pressed Power Button previously. This point comes up only has a habit from my previous model usage, which would clear the memory after pressing Power Button.
Monsoon 15 or 30 mIn spin cycle options is still present and useful, though not that great. Nothing exceptional, but Value for money and suitable for small family on relatively tight budget.",4.0

Samsung is a great brand and has been improving all the time
Super quick delivery and installation ( just had to remind Cust Care to get it done !)
Ease of Use and similar to the old Samsung 6.2 kgs
Quick wash and uses lesser water than the older Samsung 6.2 Kgs
Exchange offer of Rs 1800 ! through Amazon / dealer provides only Rs 500 ! Exchange offer
Awesome product for the money paid !!!

Cons
Samsung 6.2 kgs bought about 10 years back is bigger than the present 6.5 kgs !
Slightly shakes when the clothes are less which i believe is normal for any washing Machine
Hence the rating of 4 star !",4.0

Not good parts

The machine drum spins less. It doesn’t spins for a whole round or two and changes direction. It feels like it’s week but it is not. But I think if it spins full it will be more powerful and effective.

One must remember that it has no memory, that means if power goes off then it will not be continuing from the same moment where it was obstructed. Although it will restart in that particular stage from beginnings.

Rat mesh quality is poor. It was already cracked when i opened the tub. It is very thin. Drainage pipe is very short. Although you can extend it by installing another pipe from market.

Delivery was on time. Product was Nicely packed.

Very few like normal and normal + soak, quick wash. Automatic water level picking. There is no aqua mode in this machine, where you can fill water and let the machine spin without taking by itself from the tap. Product got delivered as promised but service/installation was delayed by two weeks due to lockdown. My old machine was taken during the product delivery itself.

The washing machine is definately a value for money with trust of samsung after sales network. There is no issue with the delivery and it was hassle free installation within a day of delivery.
There is no big noise whenever you machine operates. Some chim sound to notify you that buttons are being pressed, on/off and once it completes whole cycle it did the chim sound again. Overall nice operation and good amount of washing.
The machine dont have soft closing lid feature, and samsung guy told me that this particular machine didn't come with 10 years motor warranty. The 10 years warranty is for wobble technology one.

The product warranty in the Description section says 2 additional years for the motor, while the Features and Details section specifies 10 years warranty for the motor. Clearly there is a confusion in the details provided on Amazon site itself. On further checking with Samsung, they have confirmed that the product comes only with 2 years additional warranty on motor.

Price : 5 star
Received the product for a effective price of 10.7k during great Indian festival sale. It's a competitive price for a product from Samsung Brand.

Product : 3 star
Overall a average product. Water consumption is on a higher side. The wash cycle involves product rotating in clockwise direction for 180 degree followed by anti clockwise for another 180. In normal mode, the wash happens only for around 20mins which may not be sufficient at times and there is no other mode available to increase the wash duration. Also, since it's a 680 rpm motor, the drying is also not very effective.

Amazon and Samsung Support : 5 star
Installation was provided on the same day as delivery. Samsung Support responded to the query on warranty within 24hrs and Amazon support was co operative in accepting the product return for the difference in product description.

1100,"This is really a very good Camera in this price. Beleive me I have tried all the Xiaomi, Yi and D3D Smart Wifi Cams and this I found one of the best option.

I am using these with Home Assistant and MotionEYE.
I have not inserted any SD card and using MotionEYE to directly record videos to my system.
The RTSP stream is in full hd 1080p and its really good. It loads instantly and delay is of few microseconds.
I am using 1080p feed over RTSP and 360p feed on the app so both the things can be used at the same time.
I have configured AI Face recognition using this camera to announce whoever is on my gate over my Google Home Mini and this is working really well with this cam.

Pros:
- Good Video Quality at 1080p and at Night
- Really loud speaker
- Camera Speaker can be used to trigger alarm sound
- They offer RTSP/ONVIF support for these camera which is a big deal
- Fast and Responsive App
- Ability to live view camera feed on any computer system

Cons:
Sometimes connectivity issue in the app but it can be fixed with the update.
No NAS support like Xiaomi Cameras, However I don't need it as RTSP is more then enough but having NAS support in app is a big bonus.",5.0
1101,"I bought this for Rs 2500. My honest review on using this for 2 weeks.
1) It is one of the best camera at this budget. It provides 360' degree tilting from left to right and vice versa, also up and down view is available.
2) Clarity provides 1080 pixel, which you can't get in normal security camera especially at this budget(2500rs).
3) It doesn't record the idle position, and captures any small movements. It only records if there is a movement, which is a good feature. Also it provides constant notification for every movement. Even it is a small flies it captures that too and sends the notification to mobile.
4) You just need a wifi and power point.
5) Draw back is if someone steals the camera, then you can't see anything, because everything is recorder in camera's sd card.
Even if you switch off or it doesn't get wifi you can't view or download anything.
6) if you are placing this inside the gate then it is a good option.
7) another feature is it also records the voice.
8) I inserted 128 gb sd card on this.

The app is a little buggy but that is acceptable.

Picture quality is pretty clear and the night vision is really good.

The only thing I wished for is if the vertical FOV was a little wider.

Please note - The customer service provided by TPLINK is pure garbage as before purchasing this product, I called up the toll free number of TPLINK for asking about the warranty period and the executive was so confident that even before letting me complete my question, he said "" 3 Years warranty for Tapo C200 camera "". where as in amazon product page as well as the manufacturer box, it is written 1 year. I just hope I do not face any issues with the service center people atleast while the product is in warranty.

1105,"EDIT after 7 months of 24x7 usage
=============================
The camera still works great. It has been deployed in my (covered) porch outside in Rajasthan from the day I bought it, so it faces dust and weather abuse (temperature 1-2deg in winters, ~50deg in summers). I thought of testing its outdoor capabilities, although it is stated that this is an indoor cam. It is behaving pretty well till now, nothing out of place or different than when this guy was new. Upcoming scortching summers will test it inside out, and if it stays stable throughout, I am getting 3-4 more for coverage! I somehow didn't get this level of reliability and features in any outside-rated cam available.

Just received and my God! What a little beast it is. Loads of features in this negligible amount Motion detection (3-level sensitivity adjustment), custome pan/tilt positions, camera sharing, night vision, alarm system, near 360 pan, great fov, decent 1080p, recording on phone (haven't tested sd-card thing, but it is said that it supports that too). Configuring was a breeze. It also has both speaker and microphone, so you can speak something 'into' the camera from wherever you are, and obviously can hear from the camera too. Both these things work decently, I've tested their stability well.

Most important thing, its completely hassle free, install and forget thing. Once configured, if the power goes off, it'll be ready for use, auto-connected to wifi once power is back (I know its an obvious requirement, but still I loved that). You can use the app to see the live feed & record on your phone itself (in addition to sd card in the cam) anywhere in the world, and pan/tilt remotely. I've played with almost every feature and let me tell you, its a serious deal. Build quality could use some more thoughts, but this is supposed to be used inside. Looks are great. Also the alarm sound levels are just average, but again its just an added feature and decent enough to place the creeping elements in a puddle of confusion. For alarm, it can also blink a pretty bright white LED near the camera lens, along with sound.

Only thing that remains to be seen is its 24x7 performance and durability. I've put it on duty, and will update this review after a month or so.",5.0
1106,"I was confused with this cam and Mi one and decided to try it. Really satisfied with the product. It is supporting 128gb class 10 micro SD card and I have enabled recording only during motion is detected. I never knew about this option before buying it. This helps to have data for a long time than recording it continuously. Motion sensor is really good as it detects even if there is movement by an insect.

I was really satisfied as I can see and control the camera when I am not at home and I can access the live view or recording from anywhere in the world using the Tapo app. I was not aware of this also when I had ordered it. I thought it would work only if am in the same wifi and I can access the live view or recording only from same wifi like dash cams. It alerts you when there is a motion detected and you can see the live view or recordings from wherever you are at that point of time (if mobile network is there :)",5.0
1107,"It is best of all but it's technical features are hidden which I discuss briefly:

1. App Controlled Rotable Camera.
2. Auto WiFi detect after complete set up.
3. Use Day light feature in Night instead of Night vision to get colour photo in Night.
4. You can use this camera as IP camera in any Normal CCTV DVR which supports 'Onvif' Protocol. I connect it as 5th Channel in my Normal 4 Channel CP Plus DVR and normally displayed it in Monitor.
5. You can use it remotely in any 3rd Party CCTV App (I use GCmob CP Plus App) after proper set up.
6. Use Continuous Recording instead of Motion Recording.
7. You Can Store Data in Hard Drive of your Ordinary CCTV DVR (I use CP PLUS DVR), if it is Connected with DVR through same WIFI.

Thanks Amazon and Thanks to TP-Link.",5.0
1108,"Pros:
-Motion detection is very accurate and it starts recording a few moments before the actual motion starts.
-Keeps recording on SD card even when wifi/internet is not available. You can easily access the recordings later.
-Allows sharing camera with two people. Admin has all the controls and the people you share the camera with can access the recording and view live footage. They cannot access camera controls which is a plus.
-Night vision is good. Make sure you don't place the camera behind a window glass.
-Good quality videos which makes it easier to recognize faces.
-Tapo app is intuitive and easy to use.
- Live stream can be viewed via VLC player on a laptop/PC via RTSP. Just open network stream on VLC and type your details in the following format: ""rtsp://username:password@IP Address:554/stream1""
Make sure you have created ""Camera Account"" in Advanced Settings of Tapo app first. The credentials you set there should be used for RTSP.

Cons:
-Haven't found them yet.",5.0
1109,"TP-Link Tapo is a great product. We bought this for monitoring our puppies movements at night and now we use it for monitoring his movements when we step out.

Pros:
- 360 degree horizontal view
- 2 way talk
- Alert alarm
- Configurable video recording time window
- Configurable zone for pre setting camera position
- Privacy mode
- Motion notification to mobile app are prompt (within seconds)
- Motion detection zone helps to notify only for motion within a capture zone
- Speaker volume is good

Could be better:
- Motion detection is not configurable as to notify only when to notify. This makes notifications too frequent if you are using it as a baby or pet monitor
- Audio quality gives static sometime. Could have been better
- Although speaker volume is good. It’s audio quality gives static and one has to be clear which speaking into it

1110,"Thou i havent used tech support. This is a very prompt and very good camera. It rotates 360 it tilts up and down. I can watch my dog activities and any theft act while being away from home. I have a very bad neighbour thats why have to install it. Now they are in control lol.
Night vision is fine but it focus on the glass in front of the door. So ive to keep my corridor light on in the night to record.
Cameras motion detect is smooth and detect everything sends notification right away and you can just tap on it and view who it was outside the door.such a good feature.

1111,"Need: required a non-intrusive, not-so-visible cam for corridor monitoring in my apartment, can be monitored from anywhere using mobile internet (provided cam is connected to home wifi), and with battery backup in case power goes off.

Search: Cams that satisfy all the criteria - small black mini-sized ones - did not give me enough confidence based on Amazon ratings and reviews. Saw a little bigger models (this being one) which is actually quite visible. A D3D device that I found was black colored and can be directly connected to powerbank (that was good) but rotated with movement (that would make it obvious) and used a generic market app with very bad feedback. So settled for this one, though no power backup.

What I got: Seamlessly connected to home wifi, fantastic app (both iOS and Android) with fine grained consumer grade controls. You can control motion sensitivity, tweak recording options and timings, monitor from mobile from anywhere, excellent night vision, and does not rotate on its own (in fact that is good; you can do it using the app remotely).

What I did not get: No battery backup, white color so quite visible (but you can set the LED off so it looks kind of a dummy device), no monitoring using laptop.

But I damn got used to it. No load shedding yet, but I guess one review told that you can use a converter cord and plug it into a powerbank. Very good and well made device.",5.0

1113,"Reviewing after using for around 2 months.
The Product is easy to install and use.  Configuration is easy. Stays connected on WiFI reliably. Software has enough features for a regular user.

Installation HW is included for standard wall/roof mount. If one needs a special installation away from the wall, one can also install on a bracket (which you have to arrange).

The angle adjustment. pan/tilt works in a very reliable way. One can also set some default markers (preset positions) to where camera angle can be moved with click of a button (e.g. road side view, door view, balcony view, parking view - you can set and give name of your choice).

Motion detection - One can also define zones within which one wants motion to be detected.
One can also define a schedule for motion detection and recording (which hours one wants continous  recording and which hours only when motion is detected.

Through the Tapo App, one can get alerts and also access recordings from anywhere in the world. Recordings are on the SD card which is on the camera. I wish they add an easy to use utility to support network storage. There are methods available but too technical for a common non computer literate or a geek user.

Sound - quality of microphone and speaker an average (usually camera is installed at a height and away from person talking or listening so there is not much to expect from this aspect.

Overall with a price around Rs 2500 for the camera and few hundred rupees for the memory. It is a value for money product. In the app, on one network one can add up to 32 Tapo Cameras if one wants a more elaborate setup. ",5.0

1115,"Set up few of these at parent's home for their safety, security and well-being. I am quite familiar with CCTV technologies and have been dabbling with them as part of hobby installations. I'd setup lot more complex CCTV (analog, ethernet-ones and WiFi ones) in the past, but this one was an absolute cakewalk. This device doesn't have soft-AP mode and thus needs internet connection to be connected-to using mobile app. However, the clarity, fairly acceptable night-vision, field-of-view, range of vision, WiFi range are acceptable for indoor use. The night-vision range is about 15-20 feet, but beyond 15 feet it starts getting bit unclear. In decent light, the clarity is quite high. The has the basic features of motion-detection with segmentation and zoning of screen-area, notifications to mobile. One needs a Tapo cloud account, for the mobile app. One can use the app to talk-to (i.e. 2 way like walkie-talkie) and only listen-in on the device mic. In the talk-feature, remember to talk short sentences and release the ""talk"" button on app, to avoid echo / feedback howling effect.

I wanted to disable IR LED and this camera has the option that actually resolve all my problems. I used to keep it behind a window glass but because IR LEDS are activated, it glows like the mirror and nothing is seen beyond the window glass due to IR reflection. So I wanted those disabled at Night. I had a YI DOME 1080 camera with same features and smaller size but it didn't have this feature of disabling IR LEDS , so I used to switched it off at nights everyday that was cumbersome to me. But the app and camera of this Tapo resolved all my issues. The only thing missing in this camera as compared to previous one is - Automatic Tracking/Cruise tracking and the colour production of objects at infinity.
i am using 8gb memory card class 4, an old sdcard for continuous storage upto 24 hours. For more info about the app and camera, please check it's app features on apple store or playstore. almost all features are working in the camera. Clarity is awesome that even in Night, without IR LEDS activated, it captures somehow visible streaming. Street lights are working in street so it doesn't require IR and night vision. It captures around 80ft. front visible boundary of my street in length. You can imagine how wide vision it has.

1150,"Update 2: 3rd Oct 2021
Cameras have got one or two firmware updates so far. Things have got better quite a bit now.
Playback from app has improved.
I am satisfied.
I have installed the cameras on the walls outside. Away from direct sunlight and rain though. Covered openings with tape to prevent dust and moisture getting in.
A year in, so far everything is fine.

Update 1: The Tapo app absolutely sucks. Terrible app. Sometimes takes one or two minutes to get video from camera. Viewing recorded video footage is equally painful. You have to play the entire lenght of the video to record. Ridiculous! No option to simply get files from camera. Even trying to change camera settings is lethargic.
----

I will compare this camera with Mi Camera which I also own.

C100 supports ONVIF and RTSP. It makes the camera versatile. You can connect it with software/hardware NVRs. I hooked it up with MotionEyeOS running on a Raspberry Pi.
This was the reason why I bought this camera.
You can see all RTSP/ONVIF IP cameras in grid view from a computer/Android TV.

Mi cameras don't have ONVIF/RTSP support.
Mi camera can only be viewed from a phone app. (And chromecast+google displays which most people don't have.)
No PC software or even an Android TV app for Mi camera.
You can connect it to a NAS where camera automatically uploads original recordings periodically. Tapo cameras don't have this. (You can create a NAS from your PC/RaspberryPi etc.)

Tapo C100 over-saturates colors. Too much.
Mi camera does it too but not that bad.

Field of View of C100 is narrower than Mi camera.

When Night Vision (infrared lights) is on in Tapo, three red LEDs can be seen with naked eye. It does not have invisible LED infrared. It makes the camera visible, which is bad.

Tapo camera has two hooks on bottom to wall mount. Mi camera doesn't.

Google assistant support is there for both cameras. You can cast camera to google home display/Chromecast ultra device.

Build quality of Mi camera is better than Tapo C100.

If you are only going to use a phone app to view the camera, get the Mi camera.
If you need to see cameras on laptop, get Tapo.

In case, in future Mi cameras get RTSP/ONVIF support, no doubt get Mi.",4.0
1151,"Setup was easy. Worked flawlessly until I turned of the room lights. Night vision is dead & is not switching on. Tried resetting but had same issue with night mode not functioning. Color vision Quality is accepted but the product is presently useless as it is defective. Will post an update when I get a replacement.

2nd & 3rd units Review update:
The 1st unit's replacement is already on way & I'm glad for that. The other two units worked flawlessly without any issues I faced with night mode. TP-Link's Tapo app was good with a clean UI with ability to view upto 32 cameras just like a cctv system.

Pros:
Easy setup, 128Gb storage, No SD errors like problems i faced in Mi cameras. Ability to connect the cameras to a NVR system as ONVIF protocol IP cameras.

I added these cameras to my Synology DiskStation NAS system that has amazing surveillance station software that can beat any NVR systems available in india.

Motion detection was too sensitive, had to reduce the sensitivity & muted the notifications on the phone.

These are really good stable performing cameras. I can say these are very reliable for use as IP cameras.

I'm currently using six Tapo C100 Cameras. No issues faced except for my first order. I'll be purchasing more & am planning to expand these upto 24 cameras. Waiting for the C310 outdoor camera to launch.

October's end update: Using a total of 12 Tapo C100 & 2 Tapo C200 cameras with my Synology DS218+ DiskStation NAS system. Zero hiccups. Very stable performance all streaming at 1080p 15fps. Very happy with the Tapo series cameras. Will update here on long term performance next year. Planning to add 6 more cameras but waiting for Tapo C310 outdoor to launch.",4.0
1152,"UPDATE: DON'T BUY IT FOR USING AS BABY MONITOR, COMPLETELY UNRELIABLE FOR THAT. Motion sensing notifications only work when there is a gap of 10 minutes between each motion. If the baby moves within few minutes of the previous notification, the app won't detect it, won't send a notification!

All this when the screen is continuously ON and watching the live camera feed. As I already wrote below, the TAPO APP IS USELESS for motion detection because it stops sending notifications after 5 minutes of turning off the screen.

OLD REVIEW: I bought it specifically for using as a BABY MONITOR. Camera is perfect with lots of adjustments and functions. Motion sensitivity is perfect and adjustable.

Night view (infrared) IS TOO GOOD, I can even see a tiny 1 inch toy on the bed in pitch black room!

The camera app called ""TAPO"" IS USELESS FOR MOTION DETECTION WHEN MOBILE SCREEN IS TURNED OFF. I have done 100 tweaks in the phone like disabling optimization, enable auto start, battery optimization, lock app in recents tray etc etc. But TAPO app notifications stop after 5-6 minutes of turning off the screen anyways. Obviously it's the fault of App developers because not a single other app gets killed like this like Skype, WhatsApp etc, they run perfectly in the background.

So I am forced to keep the phone's screen on continuously to receive timely motion detection notifications. Imagine the battery drain! It's around 10% battery usage per hour with screen on, whereas it will need only 2% battery per hour with screen off!

UPDATE: I have found a TRICK to decrease the battery drain while using the TAPO app. I downloaded an app from play store called BLACKR. It turns the mobile screen black (just like a locked screen) without actually turning off the screen. You can make gestures on the black screen to wake it up again. So I run the tapo app then then pull the notification shade down to run Blackr app from the shortcut. Now the tapo app keeps sending notifications for hours while the screen is black, almost like turned off. This way, the battery drain is about 4% per hour which is acceptable.

Still I would advice NOT TO BUY TP LINK CAMERA IF YOU NEED IT FOR TIMELY MOTION DETECTION NOTIFICATIONS.",4.0

1156,"This review comes after using the Tapo C100 camera for a couple of weeks

I use it to monitor a few stray cats that I take care of in my apartment. So the camera is fitted in the basement car park. I have designed a long range WiFi system and I use MotionEyeOS on a raspberry pi as a DVR.

The good points:

1. Night vision is very good. Very clear images.
2. Motion detection is good. You get a notification on the Tapo app when the camera senses movement. If you point this camera on an area which has a lot of movement, you can define zones that you want to monitor for movement.
3. Camera offers RTSP and ONIF streams. I use the RTSP stream to connect to my MotioneyeOS on the Raspberry Pi and it works quite well. That is how I am able to get still images.
4. The Tapo app is easy to use once you get a hang of it. Playback from memory card is smooth. and the live view is smooth as well (it better be!).
5. Speaker and audio is very good for the price point.
6. Easy to mount and swivel on the base.
7. Angle of view is wide.

The not-so-good points:

1. Camera only connects to 2.4Ghz WiFi and that to only to channels 1, 6 and 11. Depending on where you live, your WiFi might be weak in these channels.
2. Camera seems to go offline if there is no internet connection when it is booting up. This is a problem when there is a power cut and the Internet is not yet available before the camera boots up.
3. The alarm cannot be trigged on demand. It will automatically trigger when there is movement, if you have configured it to do so.
4. Images appear over sharpened. See example photos I have posted.
5. No cloud storage. So the cam needs to be connected to the internet for you to see the images on the card. However, this problem can be mitigated by using a DVR (MotioneyeOS in my case).

My conclusion is that for its price, the Tapo C100 is an excellent WiFi IP Camera. Just for comparison, a Raspberry Pi zero costs 1500 and a decent Raspberry pi camera with a wide angle lens and night vision costs twice as much. I have gone that route only to realise that buying a readymade WiFi IP camera is cheaper.",4.0
1157,"Product is true to its description and other reviews. The starting experience is hassle-free, mobile app and settings are simple. And the power cable is really long. :)

It does not have NAS support, but that was something which I knew while purchasing.

Would add few points which may not be present in description and reviews:

1) Motion detection is sensitive but cannot distinguish between human, animal and other moving objects. Even at the lowest sensitivity, it considers insects' movements and keeps recording.
Avoid installing it near a light source.

2) You can save some spots/positions in the 360 deg x 110 deg space as favourites and can jump to those angles quickly. But no matter where is your current camera position, if power goes or camera restarts, camera will move to its default position. There is no setting/workaround to overcome this as confirmed by their support team.

So, place the camera in a way, that the default position is towards the most preferred angle that you want to view/record.

3) You can use a third party app to access the video feed but you will not be able to Pan or Tilt even if it claims it supports ONVIF. This is confirmed in their forum.

And just in case anyone is curious, you cannot rotate around continuously. It reaches 355 deg and stops, you have to rotate in opposite direction to reach 0. Be rest assured this will cover more than 360 deg in camera footage/ coverage, with a decent overlap.

Overall, a very good purchase for the price point if you dont care about above points.

Hope these help someone.

Talk back feature both ways is good ( tested with Mom) 3) Motion Detection and Camera detection both need to be switched on if want to get notifications for motion.

I already have a euro vigil security camera but it’s a basic one. I was quoted ₹5900 for a new camera having all the features that this camera has.

Though I was skeptical about this option at this price. I went on buying it just to explore my options.

The camera arrived and has been using it for two days now.

Pros
1. Connectivity is brilliant. You can watch live steam without any glitch on the tapo app
2. 360 rotation is very handy
3. Voice feature where you can talk through the app and speak through the camera
4. 24/7 recording though you need to buy an SD card
5. Easily mountable if you have basic pieces of equipment

Cons
1. Seems a bit bulky
2. Very fragile
3. The plastic quality could have been better

Overall seems a good buy considering the options available. I would go ahead and buy 2 more after reviewing it for another 7 days.

There is no provision for watching cam footage from remote location through cloud. I have not yet inserted the micro SD card. I am yet to try the rtsp streaming on VLC player.

1180,"Its a really good camera, had a tough decision choosing between this and the Mi Cam but i realise i made the righr choice. With accurate motion detection and good enough picture quality this is a great camera for daily usage. I have paired it with the alexa echo show 5 also and it works flawlessly. It just takes a minute to load on alexa but otherwise there is zero to no picture lag even over data, 10-20 km from the place the camera is mounted. I have been really impressed with accurate motion detection and getting alerts always on time however far away i am. But there are still some flaws when it comes to alarm as at night the alarm isnt very audible so its quite useless to alarm people inside the house but i do think it will do the job to scare anyone away atleast. But also the alarm rings sometimes when there are bees and flies close to the camera, but this is rare. The camera also has motion detection zones that i have uses and that also works flawlessly without any issues and gives accurate data.

2 way audio and video communication is wonderful. We can talk both side, similar to video calling and we can just do one way Talk also. Its nice.

Wondering if this is common issue?
Only thing I'm worried is, during surveillance, audio recording is not audible. Like if we do whole day recording or motion detection recording, if the person is not near to the camera, we won't get exact voice over of the person. Not sure this is common in all camera.
If the person stands near the camera, able to hear the voice.

1200,"I have a mi security camera already and I am using it since one year. After the lockdown, it went out of stock but soon arrived at Amazon but it's cost had increased. Even then I went ahead and tried to purchase it as I had prior confidence but just before buying Amazon showed me a feature comparison with this camera (tapo c200). So my review would be largely a comparison of the two with a breakup of the features of both security cameras.

On the feature front, this tapo camera beats mi security camera hands down. It comes with home monitoring, call/talk back feature just as mi security camera but additionally has privacy feature to switch off recording, alarm on/off on detection of movement, clean user interface, advanced self diagnosis feature, auto reboot feature and 128gb sdcard storage as against no privacy feature and 64gb in mi security camera. Also on detection of movement, mi security camera records multiple clips of max 1 min duration whereas tapo doesn't have that recording constraint. This is the biggest disadvantage of mi security camera. The setup took time as my WiFi was hidden and camera didn't recognize the hidden network even though I manually added it. But finally to overcome that, I made my WiFi network discoverable, once tapo recognized and stored it, I once again hid my WiFi and tapo didn't have any problem.

Aesthetics of tapo are however not that good as mi security camera. mi security camera feels premium when touched physically. However when you touch tapo, you get a cheap Chinese feeling which I hated when I opened the box. Moreover tapo rotates from its bottom and the rotating diameter is large. Mi security camera rotates from its middle point and the rotating diameter is consequently smaller.

Other than the rotating and aesthetics, tapo wins quite handsomely. If you want a premium feeling ( which no longer matters once the camera is setup) go for mi security camera otherwise go for tapo c200 and enjoy the rich features at a lesser price.

Will update more about its longevity in future.

Update1: After 3 months I realized that after inserting SD card, the initialisation time has increased by more than two minutes whereas in mi camera, the initialisation time hasn't noticeably changed. So mi camera wins here.

Update 2: Recording and browsing of recording in sd card in tapo is better but when tapo records any video on detection of any Movement, the green light of the camera turns to red. Also when night mode switches on, one can hear the relay sound from tapo easily. Mi camera continues to emit blue light even while recording and no relay sound comes out of Mi camera when night mode switches on. So Mi camera wins here again.

Update 3: in case of motion detection, mi camera takes an estimated 8-9 minutes to process the feed and send you a notification. That is, if a person/motion is detected at 8:00pm in front of camera, you will receive a notification only at 8:09 pm. In case of tapo, this is 4-5 minutes with a buzzer/alarm feature. Here Tapo wins down handsomely.

4. App

2. They can provide more feature in app
3. Delete option not there to clear any specific date video

5. Format memory card is not working through app.

I am using samsung 124GB class 10",3.0
1202,"I would rate it 3 stars, because Mi camera is anyway better than this TP-Link camera, because:
1) The camera takes approx 6-7secs to load and display the live footage everytime u open the camera on the app
2) The app regularly signs-out, making you feed in the login credentials multiple times.
Both point 1 and 2 combined, makes it frustrating at times to access/use the camera when you want to access the live/recorded footage on an urgent basis.",3.0

You can only watch those videos on the app.",3.0
1204,"Got the camera for 2 reasons- live streaming and to listen to audio. Had to put this in a remote office and wanted a live cam there.
So the good bits.. really easy to set up. The app is great, movements of the camera are precise and night vision is fabulous.
It connects easily to the wifi and the streaming quality is good too. However the audio was totally useless. Could'nt make out anything. Amazon didn't allow returns so I had to buy a new one(blurams, which had better video and audio quality) and use this in another location where audio was not required.
The SD card support is good, though. I used a 128GB card, whose recording you can access through phone as well.
All in all, pretty good except for the audio, which is useless.
Adding an update to this.
So , i found another camera with slightly better audio. But the acoustics of the room matter a lot. Eventually, I ordered two more of these. The reasons are:
Less fish eye effect in this camera.
Easy to record on sd card and obtain that recording through phone.
The panning is through arrows and is very precise, unlike other camera software where you have to drag the view.(it's a matter of preference, both are equally good).",3.0

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a revised review :
I am missing
1) Saving to cloud feature, In case of theft of the camera itself, this could provide clue - who, how and when stole it.
2) Noise cancellation is bad. So lot of surrounding sound is picked up during two-way call.
3) Following a moving object feature is not there.",3.0
1208,"Pros: Looks nice and compact, easy to install. Long power cord of the adapter is very useful. Picture clarity is good. Speaker volume is very good for the size.
Cons: The tapo app takes ages to open on my OnePlus 7. Once the app loads, it takes another minute or so to connect with the camera and open the feed. Streaming videos works well only with wifi, almost impossible on 4g mobile data. (tried with Vodafone, jio and BSNL ) This beats the whole purpose of the cam for me because I can't check on my kids while I am at work. Altogether disappointed.",3.0
1209,Brands service if worst. After using for 3 week my camera was not working. That is when I contacted customer care and they literally took 3 to 4 days to resolve my issue And on top of it they took 4 weeks to replace with a new piece (refurbished) which is very bad,3.0

- Less expensive (I got it for 1.5k during prime day deal)
- Good video quality
- Motion detection works fine
- Superb night vision and low light performance
- Privacy feature inside Tapco app
-Works fine with Google Home, can stream camera feed to android TV using Google Home (however camera controls like turn on/off privacy, etc are not supported in Google Home integration)

Cons:
- Microphone and Speaker quality is below average
- When using Talk option, sometime you can't hear the audio from camera side
- When using Voice Call function, it generates audio echo
- Power adaptor is bulky (light weight but bulky in size)
- No usb based power option
- Tapco app doesn't always keep you logged in, especially when you try to open the app without internet connectivity. Then you will have to re-enter the password to connect back.
- NO OPTION TO TURN OFF INFRA RED LIGHTS (WHICH IS USED FOR NIGHT VISION). THERE ARE 3 IR LEDS THAT AUTOMATICALLY TURNS ON WHEN CAMERA DOESNT DETECT ENOUGH LIGHTS. THIS IS GOOD TO CAPTURE IN LOW LIGHT OR DURING NIGHT, BUT IF YOUR INTENTION IS TO MONITOR YOUR KID - THIS FEATURE CANT BE TURNED OFF AND IT MAY CAUSE HARM TO THE EYES IF YOU/KID CONTINUESLY LOOK INTO IR LIGHTS FOR LONGER PERIOD.",3.0

-> You need to manually reset the camera and do a fresh reboot or fresh setup., Thing is this time the device can't recognise your WiFi network. It does not show your WiFi listed in the available networks.

-> Easy fix, login into your Router interface, change the wireless network frequency channel to 1 or 6 or 11. Reboot the camera device. Do a fresh setup, this time it definitely recognises your WiFi network. Also remove and insert the memory card again while setting up.",3.0

Reliability and stable functioning issues
Problem in connecting to wifi after power failure

Inconvenience in reaching camera physically when installed at heights or unreachable places to reset/remove sd card.
No software/ option to record to pc/laptop.

It's a fully loaded Watch except Inbuilt GPS you have most of the features available.

Call Notification, SMS Notification are working smooth.

Health monitoring services shows accurate value ..you just need to keep your wrist still for few secs still it's complete it analysis.

Music play is good

Alexa with limited commands display and respond back to your queries.

Display quality is good but not the best

It's a All-round budget Watch if you looking for complete Smart Watch try one with Google Wear OS might cost you around 10 to 25 k or Apple Watch.
Touch and Swiping Menu are smooth.

•HR & SpO2 Accuracy 90%. Checked with Omron & Oximeter.

•Upto 7 watch faces in watch itself

The watch faces can be customized. Health reading are correct by far. Battery backup after 1 day is use is 80 percentage. So i can expect the battery backup to last about 5 days..

 Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added.",5.0

Few key points:

- Heart Rate is accurate and working properly.
- Oxymeter sometimes accurate.
- Sleep tracking is very accurate.
- Wrist wake up is working very smoothly
- Battery will last long for 2days if you use it extensively. Meaning with all settings on like heart rate, oxygen sensor etc.
- Stress tracking is working properly but cant commit on accuracy because didn't use it extensively.
- music control is working seamlessly but only thing is song name is not visible.
- Design and built quality wise full on rating. Looks like premium watch with very less bezzels.
- UI is awesome. Smooth touch and response. Full marks to it.
- Boat Wave mobile app connectivity is quite good. With good watch faces. You can use your pic as watch face.",5.0

Walking and sleep monitoring seems accurate
Cant comment on SPO2 as I dont have any oxymeter to compare to
but good thing is I tried to take SPO2 while keeping it on couch ..it didnt show any any reading as few have mentioned that few smartwatches show SPO2 for couch or even table
I get all notifications for SMS , whatsapp messages and calls too..you can only reject calls from watch no option to take the call
I bought black color which has a golden rim on watch which makes it a bit feminine..may be a turn down for few pple

Overall watch's performance also decent, no slow or lag observed while using it.

Initial setup was frustration free, I could easily pair my watch to the boat app by scanning the 2D QR code.

specifically calling out
Alexa Voice Assistant
Personal experience:
Alexa is not at all working, I tried multiple times linking and unlinking amazon account but no hope for Alexa to work.

Watch Display:
With the increased screen size of 1.69"" inches in boAt Xtend is a welcome change, now the display looks more attractive and stylish. The screen widgets in watch faces are looking crisp and clear. Also the values from health check apps also pretty clear to see. Display is super smooth and active, no lags or sluggishness observed while touching or swiping the display while accessing it.

watch faces
In addition to the existing watch faces, introduction of new watch faces gives big ""WOW"". I could adjust the watch faces according to the current usage, basic or sports watch faces

Automatic screen brightness is pretty useful, it automatically adjust the screen brightness according to the environment which helps in saving the battery without draining unnecessarily

Stress monitor is really a useful application integrated on the watch itself, being an IT gut don't want to mention my stress level. This will be really helpful in stress situations.

boAt Xtend becomes all in one device, now I can have my health related data from my watch, need not to buy a separate oximeter or pulse meter. Just a swipe on the display brings the options in a fraction of second.

Introduction of various sports modes is really a great thing, being a sports person I can set the sports mode accordingly, personally I liked this one very much.",5.0

1383,"I'm using this watch from past 3 days and here's my initial review -

First of all It is the only smart watch that comes with dedicated SpO2 sensor which I found fairly accurate at this price point and I liked this thing about boAt.

It has IPS display but looks good because of its curved edges. Screen Brightness is good. I used it in sunlight and it was fairly visible. Colour combination of Blue and Red looks beautiful.

Battery is amazing, I charged it 100% on first day and it still has 68% ++battery after 3 day of use. I'm sure it will last 6-7 days easily.

Notification was quick in watch than in mobile, I received notifications on watch even before it comes on mobile. In Call notifications you get option to decline it right from your watch if you can't receive at the moment.

Watch has DND mode which is good for your sleep, so remember to switch it on before you go for bed.

It has find my phone feature, in case you can not figure out where you left your phone, it can make your phone ring loudly.

Strap quality is good, you can also buy new straps and replace it. Removing straps is also very easy.

*wake-up screen delays in waking about 1-2 seconds
*there is minute screen bleeding in watch
*Battery backup is not more than four days even after closing continuous HR monitor

-waterproof

Cons-
Battery life is a small issue. I turned ON almost every functionality on max except Alexa , and battery went out in 3 days. But it's acceptable as it is not a smart band.
Numbers are increased upto 10%, so watch it.

For 2999/- it's a deal breaker. If u want battery life , go for bands, otherwise it is the best smartwatch below 3499/- category.

1412,Received this product on 26th Oct.Personally i must say i did not receive any bug in this watch also point to remember that if u walk for few steps then immediately do not expect the watch to count your steps.It takes few moment to update it in your smart watch...never rely on sny smartwatch's SpO2 level as its barely accurate...The watch itself gives a premium look and dont worry about the weight...It doesn't feel heavy at all.Did not check with the sleep tracking so because of that reason its a 4 star if i am satisfied with the sleep tracking i would give it a 5..,4.0
1413,"CHINESE PRODUCT!!! This watch is rebranded of some Chinese watch. This watch pairs with VERYFIT app and it completely resembles boat app. Every boat watch is rebranded that's why they have different app for different watches.

Keeping this aside, Watch is good looking and also comfortable on wrist. Display is sharp and visible in sunlight. Accuracy at this price range is okay. Some basic features which make a watch ""SMART"" are Missing like camera shutter, Call silent feature and showing the song name in music function. Battery life is 3 days with moderate use which is Average for a smart watch at this price range. GPS in app is not working well. Step count is very accurate and also distance it measures while walking is also accurate. While cycling GPS was not working well. Watch face are not enough and most of them seems childish. Alexa feature is Hit or Miss.

Better go with Noise colourfit ultra or Realme 2 pro(I know realme is Chinese product but it's still better than this increasing budget and get better product than this) or buy mi band for fitness activities. Amazfit is also good option. Buy this only for looks. Nothing special in this.
Maybe I will return this.",4.0

1422,"I am using this watch from 4 days and I got some pros and cons for this.

Pros: -
1. The look of watch is far better then any other watch in this price range.
2. The material used in the watch is of high quality.
3. All types of monitoring works fine.
4. Build in Alexa.
5. We can use as many as watch faces.
6. The bettery backup is perfect it works for more then 3 days if the monitoring continuing till 24hrs.

Cons:
1. Alexa work with limited feature you can only cut the call, only can read notification without emojis. You can not ask alexa to call someone or text someone not even u call back someone.
2. There is build in mic but not have any speaker. So for notifications watch will vibrate but which is sufficient to notify us. Whenever u ask something to alexa the answer will writen on screen no sound you will here.
3. There is a connection issue that will be raise if you are far from your phn more then 50feet.

1423,"Review after using the watch for 18 days:
This is my first smart watch ever and after using this watch for 18 days I feel I didn't make a mistake buying this watch.
Pros:
1.Alexa built-in that too at this price point(Biggest and best pro feature of this watch)
2.Accuracy in tracking.
3.So many no. of watch faces in the app.
Cons:
1.The biggest con. of this watch atleast to me is the app always got killed in background even after giving autostart permission and unrestricted battery permission so this is becoming the biggest headache because we cannot use the full potential of the watch without app running in the background.So they must have taken care to prevent background killing of the app
2.They must have included reply to notifications atleast.
3.Alexa wake time should also be reduced.

According to me this is a good watch with some good features and there are also some improvements to be made to more polish the product.",4.0

As they haven’t mentioned in guide or on website about the screen protection (corning gorilla or not) you have to be very careful, as it prone to scratches easily, better go for screen protection.

It's a fully loaded Watch except Inbuilt GPS you have most of the features available.

Music play is good

Alexa with limited commands display and respond back to your queries.

Display quality is good but not the best

It's a All-round budget Watch if you looking for complete Smart Watch try one with Google Wear OS might cost you around 10 to 25 k or Apple Watch.

 Used this watch for over a month now.. Bought it during the first sale.. Keep reading for an unbiased review and tips/tricks to ensure all the functions in the watch are working smoothly.
1) Large Curved Display in this price category - 1.69 inch
2) Battery with heavy usage and frequently waking up the screen, alexa, alarms, notifications is about 3 days. On standby while just checking the time occassionally is about 8 days. Pretty good. Full charging time is about 1.5 hours. Decent quality magnetic charging cable provided. Use your own low power adapter, power bank or laptop.
3) Has all the necessary health / workout tracking options.. Spo2( Oxymeter), Heart Rate monitor..Accuracy is 95-98%. Sleep tracking is pretty accurate too. Paedometer is accurate most of the times, but sometimes few hundred steps are added randomly without any activity. This happens randomly once in 3-4 days. Stress Monitor is also there but not sure how it's calculated. The sensors aren not fake most probably because if the watch isn't in contact with your skin it will display a warning message and won't display data.
4) Lift to wake up gesture works but with a 1 second delay.. which is manageable. It has Tap to wake functionality too.
5) Works with most popular notifications: Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook, Instagram etc. Can read the entire SMS on watch and most of the other messages unless it's very long.
6) Calls can't be picked up or silenced.. You can only see the caller id and reject the call.
7) BT Music Control, Weather ☁️ update and Alexa are other usable smart features.
8) 50 different watch face are available on the Boat wave app. Some are really good.. You can also have customised wallpapers as watch faces . See the posted pictures.
9) The Boat Wave app is neatly organized and syncs health data without any issues instantly. The app also has assisted GPS functionality which can track your running activities on a map, in case you need that data.
10) The User Interface is smooth.. Please note that it's not laggy. The animations and transitions are a little slow but overall easy to use. Touch screen response is excellent and feels nice.
11) Overall construction is sturdy and feels nice and comfortable to wear it. It has water resistance of 5 ATM.. Can take it for a short duration swim in a pool, under the shower or rain without any worries. Watch uppper body is brushed aluminium and under body is good quality plastic. The straps are soft and also of very good quality. It doesn't irritate your skin even after wearing it for long durations. Four colour options are available with equally matching straps.. Straps can be easily replaced with fancy straps.
12 ) Works both with Android and iPhone flawlessly. Tested on both.

TIPs AND TRICKs ________________________________________

1) Boat wave app needs to run in the background all the time for your call notifications, message notifications, Alexa functionality and Weather updates. If you accidentally clear all the cache and background apps from the phone, the watch will disconnect from the phone after some time when idle ( no active inputs probably after 10-15 mins). Keep the boat wave app running in the background. Most people complaining that the watch frequently disconnected might unintentionally be clearing all the background apps. My watch was continuously connected for 4 straight days without me having to reconnect as long as the boat wave app was running in the background.

2) Alexa on this watch can do a lot of things..It can set your alarms, start the stopwatch, show weather, control Alexa based devices like Echo, wireless lights and AC, work as a simple calculator, translate simple/ short English sentences to German, Spanish, Italian, French and Portugese, get you common stock quotes from internet, can you snippets of general information from the internet in case you don't know something. Yes, Alexa on your watch getting you the information is a little slow, takes about 30 -40 seconds to process your request but it's convenient and better that taking out the phone from your pocket which might take similar amount of time or longer. In my personal experience, Alexa works a little faster on Android as compared to iphone ( maybe 2-3 second difference). Also if there is break while speaking or if there is a long sentence, then it's difficult for Alexa to understand.. Check my video.. Keep it short and you should get the results accurately
3) For Alexa to work properly: After connecting the Boat Wave app with an Amazon account, download the Alexa app and check your Xtend watch is visible under Devices option.
4) To pickup and make calls handsfree without using the phone, just use a Bluetooth headset with voice assistant function. It will work as a charm. The speaker function on most smart watches is useless as it's not convenient for calls while traveling or in a crowded place due to low volume and obviously you don't want everyone to hear your private conversation.. With voice assistant feature on your BT headset you can make a call or play music without having to touch your phone.

Few other functions which could have been provided and is missing. Actually available in many similarly priced devices :
1) Torch 🔦 - Makes the display bright white.. Comes handy in darkness.
2) Remote shutter button for camera.
3) Call silencing option could have been added.",5.0
1432,"Boat Xtend has amazing build quality and also has premium looks and feel, The watch is light in weight and fits on the wrist perfectly, the touch quality and display quality is upto the mark also this device tracks activities like footsteps, location, calories burn, stress level, heart rate and there are also ample of watch faces available in the app, i have used many other smart watches but i will prefer and also recommend this watch at a budget friendly price. boat has done it very well.",5.0

Overall watch's performance also decent, no slow or lag observed while using it.

Initial setup was frustration free, I could easily pair my watch to the boat app by scanning the 2D QR code.

specifically calling out
Alexa Voice Assistant
Personal experience:
Alexa is not at all working, I tried multiple times linking and unlinking amazon account but no hope for Alexa to work.

Watch Display:
With the increased screen size of 1.69"" inches in boAt Xtend is a welcome change, now the display looks more attractive and stylish. The screen widgets in watch faces are looking crisp and clear. Also the values from health check apps also pretty clear to see. Display is super smooth and active, no lags or sluggishness observed while touching or swiping the display while accessing it.

watch faces
In addition to the existing watch faces, introduction of new watch faces gives big ""WOW"". I could adjust the watch faces according to the current usage, basic or sports watch faces

Automatic screen brightness is pretty useful, it automatically adjust the screen brightness according to the environment which helps in saving the battery without draining unnecessarily

Stress monitor is really a useful application integrated on the watch itself, being an IT gut don't want to mention my stress level. This will be really helpful in stress situations.

boAt Xtend becomes all in one device, now I can have my health related data from my watch, need not to buy a separate oximeter or pulse meter. Just a swipe on the display brings the options in a fraction of second.

Introduction of various sports modes is really a great thing, being a sports person I can set the sports mode accordingly, personally I liked this one very much.",5.0

First of all It is the only smart watch that comes with dedicated SpO2 sensor which I found fairly accurate at this price point and I liked this thing about boAt.

It has IPS display but looks good because of its curved edges. Screen Brightness is good. I used it in sunlight and it was fairly visible. Colour combination of Blue and Red looks beautiful.

Battery is amazing, I charged it 100% on first day and it still has 68% ++battery after 3 day of use. I'm sure it will last 6-7 days easily.

Notification was quick in watch than in mobile, I received notifications on watch even before it comes on mobile. In Call notifications you get option to decline it right from your watch if you can't receive at the moment.

Watch has DND mode which is good for your sleep, so remember to switch it on before you go for bed.

It has find my phone feature, in case you can not figure out where you left your phone, it can make your phone ring loudly.

Strap quality is good, you can also buy new straps and replace it. Removing straps is also very easy.

There are a lot of watch faces available through the boAt Wave app, just download your favourite and install it. You can even edit and place your own photo as watch face.",5.0
1462,This smartwatch from boat is really amazing in looks as well as features. It has built in alexa voice assistant to control functions on the go. The display is very nice and attractive.

 Perfect for anyone in everything.
I've just ordered this Boat smart watch on the launch day and it was most awaiting for me because i wanted to have such watch since long time so I'm very happy with results of it as it has 1.69 inches big display, plus it has built in alexa voice assistant so that we can easily do our work by telling alexa. Also the features are amazing like we can put some trendy and stylish watch faces, automatic screen brightness and color variants are also good. In today’s time our health is also very important subject so we can definitely take some help by wearing this smart watch because it can measure your heart rate and SPO2 monitoring also helps to guide meditative breathing. We can monitor our stress too which is amazing.
All in all this is the best watch for everyone must have it. You can definitely go with this because of its features, looks and results.",5.0
1464,"1. Built in Alexa Voice Assistant :- this is just unbelievable ,voice assistant on a watch and that is also so trusted Alexa. I can't believe that in this midrange watch I can find this feature it's unbelievable.

2. 1.69’ inches big square display :- big square display is good enough and clear enough to make a clarity view in any condition any temperature and anywhere.

3. Multiple watch faces :- in this watch I have found many unique watch faces that I love to change it daily and use it as per my mood.

4. Automatic screen brightness :- this automatic screen brightness is same as my phone and is so good that I don't need to worry about where I am ,it always light enough to make a clear view to my watch.

5. Guided Meditative Breathing and Stress Monitor :- breathing and stress monitor is so helpful in this watch to monitor my health, as it is a smartwatch so overall it's a complete package.

6. Heart Rate & SPO2 monitoring :- I really don't need a oximeter now I can monitor sqO2 heart rate with my watch only.",5.0

When going out for an outdoor activity which is walking in my case and I start the activity so that you can monitor your heart rate as you keep walking. I don't have much use of Alexa as I have my mobile with me all the time. Also I don't miss the GPS feature as my mobile is always with me. Notifications are rec'd and incoming calls can be viewed. I don't keep the watch connected to bluetooth all the time. I have used the watch for a week now and still have a battery of 20% left.

- can get your WhatsApp Instagram and call notifications easily

Pros
1) larger screen and good UI
2) App is good

Cons:
1) Display transitions are not that smooth
2) Alexa interactions/commands fail almost 70-80% of time.
3) when trying to enable data sync to Goggle fit getting warning that boat app is not trusted by Google. That needs immediate fix
4) It calculates spo2 of couch as well. But compared the human readings of HR and Spo2 with other band (honor 5) and both are pretty much the same.
5) With Realtime monitoring ON, battery goes only for 2.5 days

 I ordered the day it launched.. Delivery was quick as I received the watch very next day..
Packaging was simple came with smartwatch, warrantycard, charging cable, etc
I will divide my review in Like and Dislike about the watch..
Likes~
*Looks stylish big screen
*Great Features
*Good price
*Value for money

Dislikes~
*it lags when going from one feature to other
*No flashlight as written in description
*there comes 10-15 notifications of the same notifications from whatsApp and YouTube which gets irritating
*wake-up screen delays in waking about 1-2 seconds
*there is minute screen bleeding in watch
*Battery backup is not more than four days even after closing continuous HR monitor

Conclusion:- This watch needs serious firmware update on notifications problem and wake-up screen problem.. Overall good product in this price range

It's been three days only, Will update more after few months of use",4.0
1483,"I used this watch almost for a month and found few issues like it doesn't track your sleep accurately but that's doesn't matter for most of us.
Alexa built in feature doesn't work at all. It's says doesn't recognise everytime.

It is perfect for swimmers, gym lovers, running and other type of activities.
Looks good and mostly suits on all casual wears.
Battery life is good and goes for 3-4 days with full charge.
With normal usage battery goes for a week sometimes.

- doesn't throw random numbers on HR, SPo2. If it doesn't detect wrist, shows error msg.
- light weight, high on functionality.
- display gets very bright, even for direct sunlight.
- small bezel, Big display
-very good watch faces, can also use pictures from gallery.
-waterproof

Cons-
Battery life is a small issue. I turned ON almost every functionality on max except Alexa , and battery went out in 3 days. But it's acceptable as it is not a smart band.
Numbers are increased upto 10%, so watch it.

For 2999/- it's a deal breaker. If u want battery life , go for bands, otherwise it is the best smartwatch below 3499/- category.
Smaller wrist people can also go for it.",4.0

However, gets disconnected from mobile bluetooth quite ofter. No speaker in watch. So while you can speak to Alexa voice, it will only show text of the response.

It is decent as first wearable purchase in 2021. The crown and curved edges mimics the apple vibe decently.

1490,Received this product on 26th Oct.Personally i must say i did not receive any bug in this watch also point to remember that if u walk for few steps then immediately do not expect the watch to count your steps.It takes few moment to update it in your smart watch...never rely on sny smartwatch's SpO2 level as its barely accurate...The watch itself gives a premium look and dont worry about the weight...It doesn't feel heavy at all.Did not check with the sleep tracking so because of that reason its a 4 star if i am satisfied with the sleep tracking i would give it a 5..,4.0
1491,"CHINESE PRODUCT!!! This watch is rebranded of some Chinese watch. This watch pairs with VERYFIT app and it completely resembles boat app. Every boat watch is rebranded that's why they have different app for different watches.

Keeping this aside, Watch is good looking and also comfortable on wrist. Display is sharp and visible in sunlight. Accuracy at this price range is okay. Some basic features which make a watch ""SMART"" are Missing like camera shutter, Call silent feature and showing the song name in music function. Battery life is 3 days with moderate use which is Average for a smart watch at this price range. GPS in app is not working well. Step count is very accurate and also distance it measures while walking is also accurate. While cycling GPS was not working well. Watch face are not enough and most of them seems childish. Alexa feature is Hit or Miss.

Better go with Noise colourfit ultra or Realme 2 pro(I know realme is Chinese product but it's still better than this increasing budget and get better product than this) or buy mi band for fitness activities. Amazfit is also good option. Buy this only for looks. Nothing special in this.

4. Build in Alexa.
5. We can use as many as watch faces.

Cons:
1. Alexa work with limited feature you can only cut the call, only can read notification without emojis. You can not ask alexa to call someone or text someone not even u call back someone.
2. There is build in mic but not have any speaker. So for notifications watch will vibrate but which is sufficient to notify us. Whenever u ask something to alexa the answer will writen on screen no sound you will here.
3. There is a connection issue that will be raise if you are far from your phn more then 50feet.

Notifications pop up multiple times and you will have to delete 1 notification for 4-5 times.

1. Good looks, People notice.
2. Watch face attractive.
3. Battery Life good.
4. Drink water reminder.

Cons

1. Calories and distance not accurate particularly for Treadmill walk. It measures only by hand movement. If u are holding the handle bar and walk, watch doesn't recognise.

2. My treadmill data and watch data readings are very much apart.

3. I have a feeling that some of the readings are not true measurements but some software generated figures.

3. Call and Msg alert is erratic. Even though I do the setting , alerts accuracy is not 100%.

4. Watch wakes up when you move your hand on bed during sleep. Room suddenly lights up...

5. Heart rate and SPO2 seems okay.

Well, Battery life is ok, didn't tried the sleep tracking yet, i thought to purchase mi band 6 but being owned a mi band 4 already made me purchase this one, purchased the sandy cream color which looks absolutely gorgeous than other colors.

>No goals setting feature with friends within app

>Boat wave app looks decent, but can be even more optimised

> Watch Looks cool but when you set analog watch face, it hangs at times, so I am forced to use digital watch face

Pros:

>battery lasts up to 6 to 7 days , which Is decent

>readings are fine and I believe it to be close to accurate

Cons:
1. The display is not at all colorful. It is so dull that it actually makes you dislike the watch. C'mon that's the least expectation from a 4k watch. Display is really really dull and bad.

2. Doesn't connect to Google Fit. Well, it does in theory but the steps taken in watch won't ever be updated in your Google fit account. So if you've taken insurance and get discounts with steps taken (my agenda), it doesn't fullfill that agenda.

3. Steps count are inaccurate and doesn't match at times. The app keeps logging out and when you log back in, it mismatches the steps

4. I wore it at night to check my sleep, and I couldn't find any record in the app next morning. In fact, it is still showing only one day sleep recorded on July 8th for 3 hours. Guess I'm a sleepless zombie now..

Verdict: Don't go for this clock. Many wonderful options available at this budget.",2.0

1. All watches (I saw every brand's review before purchasing this) in 2k - 3.5k have similar UI for watch and app.

2. This watch lags a lot!

3. Lags, even more, when you see extra characters in messages.

4. Not accurate at all, for accuracy, I'd give 30 out of 100. Counted steps even when I was sleeping, guess how many? 500 - 600 steps... Yes...

5. Organized copy of Chinese watches.

6. The lag issue was resolved in the app's FAQ😊 developers (Should I call them developers?) put the answer there, and it says that the watch is ""designed that way"" Amazing answer!

7. Few of my friends sent me some emojis on WhatsApp, this watch surprised me 😍 I saw everything in Mandarin Chinese🙂🙂

8. Changes the readings even in a difference of a minute.

9. My friend came to my house and I was showing its features, ye sath nahi degi rehenedo...

2: Steps meter works on GPS i guess , when i travel on bike it counts every step so isn't accurate that way.
3: Alexa only does stuff that is listed in description so don't bother asking it to call someone and most of times it doesn't understand as well.
4: you can't voice activate alexa you need to press the button or swipe to talk to alexa.

LOL I might have plugged these in and out a million times a year and still these hold up really well. Even though these are made out of plastic, these are quite rough and tough.

They offer a reasonable price for their product and also provides good lifetime of the pendrive.

1690,"My primary preference for flash drives has always been SanDisk. In the early years before SanDisk came along, I had used some other lesser known brands - and had invariably ended up losing data (""Cannot be Detected"" type of errors). As a musician, I need to transfer heavy music project files between audio studios, mastering studios, etc. and for reasons of confidentiality and security, one can't use services like SendSpace and WeTransfer. I have always used SanDisk flash drives and I have faced no problems, no glitches. One doesn't need to carry an external hard drive and risk the other contents of the drive - much easier to use separate flash drives for separate projects.

Bottom Line: SanDisk is reliable, safe and trustworthy. That's all you need when you buy a flash drive.",5.0

After 2+ years of usage, I'm writing the review for it.

Good product at this Price

Pros:
1) Really Value for money. Good pen drive at this cost.
2) Performance is good.
3) Pocket-friendly, weightless & small in size.
4) I have been using more than 2 years and its still working fine.

1700,"At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy this pendrive, because of its price. Of course, there were other alternatives like HP, but I thought, anyway let's give this one a try. So, I ordered it and it arrived the next day. I bought this for my Xbox 360 E and my PS4 and it worked like a charm. Although it says 32gb, I only actually got 28gb. I would say this pendrive along with its read/write speed is really worth it.

I did some experiments with data transfer. I transferred about 40GB to and from this USB stick.

1756,"This is probably the most bought pen drive in its segment. On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.) The second drawback is the color. As it is the same for everyone else, so losing it in office (college groups) is quite possible. The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.

It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability. The speed it gives is not lightning fast but it works for most Indian made laptops (or desktops).

1765,"Awesome pendrive by SanDisk. Obviously u can not expect very fast data transfer from this product as it has 2.0 port but overall the data transfer rate is satisfactory and it gives an average of 4-5mbps at simple file copying and pasting process.
Overall I will recommend u to buy it as it is worth for money.",4.0
1766,"The best product in this value range. when Copying huge documents speed is 15MBps so no need to wait for a longer time.

Working good, I must say nice Pendrive.

The combo pack is worth for the lowest price of Rs.649.

The product is of plastic and its an advantage we can use it roughly and it withstands.

Indeed, even I dropped it multiple times or more, nothing happened.

Thank you.",4.0
1767,"The pendrive is ok on the general level. it is original, arrived quite fast, and is durable and versatile in handling and usage. The speed of writing on the drive remains constant between 7-10 mbps. However, the main drawback was that its space was only 57 GB.",4.0
1768,"the pen drive is ok.
its been reliable. but speed is slow for a 16gb pen drive.
more than 8gb you should buy a USB 3.0 Pen Drive to get good speeds, unless its for archiving something important band you wont be writing to it again and again.

PS: I didnt know this before but i have observed that USB 3.0 drives function faster even on USB 2.0 ports, so there IS an advantage even if you dont have USB 3.0 port on your desktop/ laptop.",4.0
1769,Made up of plastic. The front portion which goes inside the cpu is of plastic. Other pendrive i have has steel portion. You have to be careful while keeping it. The plastic is soft and can be easily broken. Usage. Wise it is 2.0. so max transfer speed is fluctuating between 1 to 10 mbps. So speed is also not good. Good for moderate use. Price is also comparatively less. So if you are looking for a cheap one with moderate use then it is good.,4.0
1770,Storage capacity will be less than advertised by company because of different standards of capacity calculation usable space is 29 gb. Build quality is okay because usb side plastic is flimsy. Write speed is nominal depending on the file size. Average speed i get is 7 MBPS. Overall performance is good although its usb 2.0. Good value for money and backup option.,4.0
1771,Quality and usage are very good. But I calculated the storage to be around 59 GB. But what I got is 57 GB. Users are losing almost 6 GB this way. Otherwise there are no issues. SanDisk has always been reliable producer of good pendrives.,4.0

Data transfer for a couple of minutes and it starts to heat up. On the contrary, my friend's HP pen drive works very cool and you won't even feel it's temperature despite it have a metallic body.

The GOOD

The San Disk 16 GB flash drive is one of the most cheapest and smallest flash drive in the market.
It is small and convenient to carry but you can loose it easily.
It has good build quality
The read and write speeds are satisfactory for daily transfer of files.
Option to protect sensitive documents or files by using the provided software which is loaded on the pen drive.
You also have the option to put it in a Keychain.
The BAD
It's small and easy to loose
It gets a little warm when copying and pasting files.

Overall it is a really great flash drive.",4.0

1798,"I have been using a similar drive of 4GB capacity from last 2 years. The drive was purchased for my office and its working absolutely fine with several writes each day. I was using this drive to test the software developed for our office product where I had to write huge amount of machine data every 1 hour. The tests were done for almost 3 months. The drive is still working fine after so much of writes.

The plastic quality is bit cheap and the USB socket is prone to break quite easily as the corners of the plastic are very slim. All in all, if you use it wisely and does not get it crushed beneath heavy objects, it will work superbly.
Read and Write speeds are well for a normal day to day work. Nothing special in it, but its build to last electronically quite a few years.

Being a satisfied user of the 4GB version which was for office use, I ordered a personal one of 16GB just recently because I had to consume the amount in my prepaid card.

If you are looking for simple, build to last (functionality wise), for day-to-day copy needs, normal size of data transfers, go for it.
If you want metallic finish, robust build quality, or a large data transfer every now and then, look for Kingston Drives. They are tough in structure, but R/W speeds are less compared to similarly priced products.",4.0

4- Good option, as sandisk is always a trustable company, but somewhere I think 59 gb is not fair out of 64.

1840,"My primary preference for flash drives has always been SanDisk. In the early years before SanDisk came along, I had used some other lesser known brands - and had invariably ended up losing data (""Cannot be Detected"" type of errors). As a musician, I need to transfer heavy music project files between audio studios, mastering studios, etc. and for reasons of confidentiality and security, one can't use services like SendSpace and WeTransfer. I have always used SanDisk flash drives and I have faced no problems, no glitches.

1. Slow data transfer speed, but overall GOOD",5.0
1849,"Quality and reliability, for data storage, nothing to out smart SanDisk in affordable pricrange.
The only thing is that the cruzer blades are small and can get lost or replaced. I put them in small key rings along with a piece of thick cardboard and write the details of data on the cardboard.
Item I bought is the most reasonably priced by this seller. And prompt delivery.",5.0
1850,"At first, I was a bit hesitant to buy this pendrive, because of its price. Of course, there were other alternatives like HP, but I thought, anyway let's give this one a try. So, I ordered it and it arrived the next day. I bought this for my Xbox 360 E and my PS4 and it worked like a charm. Although it says 32gb, I only actually got 28gb. I would say this pendrive along with its read/write speed is really worth it. And if you're worried about the fake pendrive, don't worry, this is the original pendrive which comes with 5 years warranty. If you're looking for a reliable pendrive at a really low price, I would highly recommend this one.",5.0
1851,"This is one pendrive I am purchasing it repeatedly from the beginning, when I started using pendrives. My usage is simple, for my car audio and as a storage device. Still now I have not faced any issues with this black and red pendrive. I have other 3.0 versions and otg pendrives too, but this one is the most ecomoical of all for basic needs.
The speed I use to notice when transferring files from my computer varies between 1.25MB/s to 7.45MB/s, which is not a big issue for me as long as it solves the purpose. Overall a reliable pendrive for me for years.",5.0

1859,"A great little USB with fast speeds and high storage for a relatively low price.
My own complaint is that the USB is surprisingly tiny. I thought it would be a normal sized pen drive. But honestly it's more like a micro-usb. It's about an inch and a half. It might be the smallest USB I've ever owned. I'm always worried that I'm going to misplace it.

I did some experiments with data transfer. I transferred about 40GB to and from this USB stick.
For large file sizes (>100MB to 2GB): Write speed 10MB/s, Read speed 25MB/s, write/read speed is constant
For small file sizes (1KB to 50MB): Avg write speed 6MB/s, Avg read speed 6MB/s, write/read speed varies between 2MB/s to 20MB/s",4.0
1879,When a person purchases 128 GB pen drive then it surely means that he is going to store large files in it. But this pen drive has FAT32 system which allows to store files of size upto 4 GB. I had to convert its system to NTFS through third party software to store files having size larger than 4 GB. So I think the file system of atleast a 128 GB pen drive should already be NTFS.,4.0

1881,Normal usb nothing really new about its buut you cant use it as flashable pen drive so keep that in mind its format is different its not removable drivers when u put into pc its more like a hard type of memory so dont expect it to run bootable Windows on it. You can make it bootable but its quite complex and alot of hasle so if you want to buy it for windows as cd or usb bootable disk i suggest you go for Kingston instead becoz those formats are bootable,4.0

Now we only have to talk about product -
Writing speed 4-5MBPS
Reading speed 15-18MBPS
It's writing speed(from PC to Pendrive) is only 4MBPS that's really bad as compare to SanDisk Cruzer Blade 8Gb it gives writing speed somewhere 9-10MBPS.
While Reading speed has almost no difference in 8GB and 16GB SanDisk Cruzer Blade Pendrive.

But if we compare price of 8gb and 16gb Pendrive there only 50-60 rupees difference. you get double of storage at just 50-60 rupees. 16GB Pendrive is better buy if we compare price and Value 4 money",4.0

I know you would consider this review silly but this pen drive isn't super fast but gets the work done.
The packing is improved better than it used to be plus the transfer rates between 7MBPS to 15MBPS.

► Suitable for storing songs
► Works with almost any hardware

But even after broken tip the pen drives are working fine.",4.0
1886,"This is probably the most bought pen drive in its segment. On the negative side, this has a plastic jack to insert, which breaks in about 6 months of regular use. (If you are handing it to youngsters it would probably break sooner.) The second drawback is the color. As it is the same for everyone else, so losing it in office (college groups) is quite possible. The company could think of coming up with more color options for easy differentiation.

It is easy to use and carry, so that makes up on the durability. The speed it gives is not lightning fast but it works for most Indian made laptops (or desktops). If you plan to use it with your car stereo system, I would suggest you go for a pen drive with a metal body (this won't work for long).",4.0

The plastic is drawback as the front inserting plastic broken but still we can insert..usually it will break as we plug and unplud frequently.. Apart from that it is the best budget pendrive... Buy it only if it is low priced . below 260rs. Dont buy if it is above 300 for 32gb pendrive. It has good speed and long lasting... Water proof.. Very much useful for boot usb.

The overall build quality ( including speed ) vs price when compared with other ones is impeccable.
Cons :

its been reliable. but speed is slow for a 16gb pen drive.
more than 8gb you should buy a USB 3.0 Pen Drive to get good speeds, unless its for archiving something important band you wont be writing to it again and again.

The plastic is soft and can be easily broken. Usage. Wise it is 2.0. so max transfer speed is fluctuating between 1 to 10 mbps. So speed is also not good. Good for moderate use. Price is also comparatively less. So if you are looking for a cheap one with moderate use then it is good.,4.0
1900,Storage capacity will be less than advertised by company because of different standards of capacity calculation usable space is 29 gb. Build quality is okay because usb side plastic is flimsy.

The GOOD

The San Disk 16 GB flash drive is one of the most cheapest and smallest flash drive in the market.

Option to protect sensitive documents or files by using the provided software which is loaded on the pen drive.

than 6 months and writing review now.
1. It had a consistent average write speed of 3.5MB per sec which is lesser than a sandisk class 4 memory card which goes to 8MB per second. It took me an hour to fill the complete space with Bollywood songs and cartoon movies for my nephew and nieces.

The read speed however goes ad high as 20 MB per second which is pretty good for copying.
I just filled 16 GBs with movies for once and play it on TV. Previously I used it on set top box for recording. You can use it for small data transfers measuring in 100- 200 MBs.

As per performance is considered i would suggest for USB 3.0 pen drives;which i have one writes 8-9 MB per sec almost 4 times fast than USB 2.0.

Build quality it average and fragile; and tip usually breaks easily with little mishandling.

Thanks.",3.0

It's pretty small and you don't even need too much space to keep it.Now the bad things_ 1) Speed: -the data transferring speed is not good.t Other device in this price range is better than this.2) Build Quality: -the build quality of this device is not up my to the mark. It's made up of cheap kind of plastic and there are some creacky noise.3) Design: -it doesn't looks good. Looks so cheap and not cool.Well guys these are my experience with SanDisk cruzer blade flash usb drive. I'm using this device for 5-6 months and really I'm not satisfied.,3.0

1. Initially it feels a bit weird talking to a speaker but you get used to it in no time.
2. The sound quality is pretty good. You get good depth of sound with decent bass.
3. Several skills available and you will definitely find some very useful. For example adding stuff to shopping list or setting up a reminder.

2081,"Presently there are two major competitors for smart speakers in India i.e., Amazon echo dot and Google home mini. I am user of both. Trust me Amazon echo has nailed their product by this 3rd generation upgrade.
->Beautiful modern look with good sound and super microphone sensitivity. Google home with its 2 microphone is far behind on picking user command especially when music is on as compared to alexa(4 microphones). So hardware wise Echo dot(3rd gen) is clearly winner with louder sound, better bass and better microphone sensitivity.
->Alexa response time is faster plus it hears me out in most of noisy situations. I literally have to shout to google home sometimes.
->Music listening experience is breeze on alexa with prime account. Amazon music is tailored made for India having songs and playlist for festival occasions. Google music doesn't have festival playlist. Google music team doesn't pay heed to Indian festivals and occasions. I couldn't find diwali playlist on Google Music(being a pro member). Moreover Alexa is quick on catching keywords whereas Google is slow and sometimes unable to catch keywords. Moreover google home interaction with gaana and saavn is not perfect. It doesn't able to find songs many times even if song is there on Gaana(being pro user).
->Google home is better for continued conversations because it knows context but I think conversation with these devices dies out after few days of excitement. And then you only use these for doing daily jobs- playing news, songs, reminders, questions and answers, alarms in which alexa is better(due to its hardware advantage). Although I wish Amazon add context conversation to Alexa along with voice profile feature(multi user voice recognition) which is present on Google home.
->Google home has one major advantage that it supports hindi language(commands and response). I wish Amazon add this feature to alexa.
->Lastly Alexa has vast collection of skills in India- playing radio stations, flight search and price(cleartrip integration), zomato restuarant suggestion and food ordering, ola and uber cab booking, railways pnr enquiry and train availability, hindi jokes(better than on google home), meditation, exercise, devotional songs, and many more. Google home is lacking on many of these useful skills like flight search and price, ola, uber, zomato,radio stations, train availability, etc.
->Alexa integration with amazon firestick is on its way according to Alexa Indian team. So it is an useful addition of feature for those who have amazon firestick.
Conclusion->If you are a prime user, Amazon echo dot is the best choice for you among all competitors. If you are buying for your family or someone else not comfortable with english, then Google home is your only choice right now(as it supports hindi language).
UPDATE!!!-> Amazon has brought in much requested contextual conversation and continued conversation feature to Alexa like in Google home known as ""Follow-Up Mode"" which can be enabled from settings.",5.0
2082,"I bought 3rd gen Echo Dot.... here are some pros and cons:
Pro's.
1. Great improvement in sound quality when compared to the 2nd generation DOT.
2. Alexa understands Indian accent well and the one sold here is customized only for India.
3. Design and build quality is very good. I liked the fabric design over the plastic on the 2nd gen DOT
4. Just say what you want to buy from Amazon and it will purchase/add it to your cart. Alexa will buy it provided you have given her permissions, it can be controlled using Alexa app on your mobile.
5. You can make her connect to a bigger speaker using bluetooth or Aux for better quality sound.
6. Alexa can play songs of your choice from Amazon prime music as well as Tune-in radio. You can enable other radio stations aswell.
7. The best part of Alexa is that she can set reminders, to do lists and Alarms. She can set multiple alarms and reminders.
8. You can ask her any random questions, calculations, general knowledge etc.

Cons.
1. You need Amazon prime subscription to search and play for songs. I won't recommend Echo to anyone without Prime subscription.

Over all I'm happy with Alexa. She is a good smart companion. Alexa is intelligent and there are lot of things you can do, just some spent time with her and you will be amazed. Amazon will be enabling Alexa with more skills, it's a worth buying.....",5.0
2083,"1) Firstly, you may be confused whether to buy Google Home or Alexa. If you are an Amazon Prime customer, the choice is a no-brainer because you get Amazon Music for free as well as tight integration with Amazon Products.
2) The sound produced by this device is good for filling one bedroom with rich sound. Arijit Singh never sounded so deep :).
3) The microphone is super sensitive. You can even whisper ""Alexa"" and the device will pick it up.
4) The Alexa skills available are amazing which can be turned on through the companion app. Few skills you should try are
4.1) Radio tuning=> Just say Alexa Play Radiocity. Get back into the radio habit.
4.2) For the religious => Just say Alexa wake me up at 6 AM to Suprabhatam. Done deal.
4.3) For the romantic => Just say Alexa open Love Shayari. Ghalib at your finger tips.
4.4) Want a multiplayer quiz fight => Just say Alexa QuizMaster. You will be playing it at 10 AM.
4.5 ) Interactive Stories for Kids => Just say Alexa MagicDoor.
4.6) Apps by Magoosh to build vocabulary are awesome.
5) Alexa can calculate, tell you the calories in an egg, convert feet to inches and all the regular things.
6) The most useful features
6.1) Alexa add milk to shopping list. Viola! milk is added as a list item in the shopping list on your app. Very useful for my wife.
6.2) Drop In using your Alexa App to talk to people at home. Very useful.
7) Setting Alexa up is a breeze and since she is cloud based the intelligence keeps improving.

2087,"My childhood friend and a great well-wisher Sri Radha Krishnan gifted me Rs. 3000/- and wanted me to buy anything that I like.
I thought, I should buy something that is very special in my lifetime and fortunate to get a Third Gen Amazon Eco Dot at that price during Amazon Great Indian Sale.
I feel, my REVIEW here should be different and I am not repeating anything said already.
I placed ECO Dot permanently into an electrical socket by doing some neat homework, which you can see in the pictures.
What I learnt, We need to ask diplomatically to the point first.
For example, I asked Alexa, calorie value of a banana ? and Alexa could not answer. She answered beautifully when the same query put into a different way, nutrition value of a banana.
Kindly include (from 1960s) old classical songs from Tamil and Hindi movies.
Hope, Alexa learn more and more every day & soon create a very rich database and focused locally as well..

TIPS:
1. If you like to keep on wall power socket as I did, you must use only original 3M Double sided tape (https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B013JM1SCY/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1). After pasting the tape and attaching both plug and the unit leave an hour for bonding before inserting into a wall socket tightly to avoid falling down. If you do not like, you can separate them neatly anytime in future by using a Dental floss/ fishing rod nylon thread.
2. I have paired the ECO DOT with my AV Receiver (ONKYO HTS 3370) easily but you need little patience. Switch on ECO DOT and the Blue Tooth Device make them search and pair. Alexa will confirm and you need to say ‘Alexa connect to speaker’ in future. While configuring, never keep open other BT devices like your Laptop/ Mobile to avoid over lapping.",5.0

2091,For 2000 using 10% off..you are getting a bulb worth 500...making echo dot 1500 which at roughly 20 dollars is same price you get in deals in USA. So no more asking friends to get them from there!!!! Anyone sitting on the fence can buy this instead of buying bluetooth speakers. This is 5th Echo dot including earlier versions and Google Mini doesnt even come close when it comes to smartness. While Google mini answers google search questions better - no one is buying a smart speaker for that. Its integration with smart devices is unparalled and my mini appears dumb most of the times. Just grab this before it goes back to its old price. Even the smart bulb is very helpful. While watching TV..just ask Alexa to turn bulb blue or red!! Not sure if this bulb can dim...if so..you can use this both as a day bulb and a night bulb. Just go for it before its too late,5.0
2092,"It's true that Alexa could more than just a simple voice assistant that plays music on your request.
It listens to anything you say and answers smartly. Alexa got an attitude which is quite amazing.
Siri, Cortana, and other voice assistants are no match for Alexa. Alexa acts better than Google in terms of finding information.

It can almost answer to any anything whether your question related to history, IPL cricket scores or mythology. Alexa answers all of them with details.

You can literally have a conversation with her and she is a great distraction when you're really tired of talking to real people.

The money you spend on this device is definitely worth its value and time.

the only negative I have is that you have to connect the dot to the power source. I wish dot comes with an in-built battery backup and it could work for a few hours without the continuous power supply.",5.0
2093,"I am using alexa dot 2nd Gen and today I have gifted dot 3rd Gen to my Daddy.
1. I see of difference in sound quality compared 2nd gen. Sound quality is amazing.
2. It is louder than 2nd Gen Dot
3. One thing disappointed is that when say 'Alexa, play old telugu songs' in 2nd Gen Dot it Play old songs from retro station but in 3rd gen Dot it is playing telugu songs'(not telugu old songs). When I specially say 'Alexa play telugu retro station songs' it is playing old songs of specific combination of male and female singers.

I will update the review after days again but it's 5 star rating for now",5.0
2094,"Great product. Bought aprox. one month ago. We desired variety of songs in Hindi, Telugu and it played all of them immediately with out taking time. It answered variety of questions. I am enjoying the company with the songs as per my desire and with answers for my questions. My wife and my daughter are also happy with this product. May be I am enjoying because of my prime membership as most of the songs it picked from prime music and very few from saawn. Even we are asking alexa the time, when we wake in between nights.",5.0
2095,I had been using the echo dot 2nd generation for some time now and was quite pleased with it. So when they launched the 3rd generation echo dot with better speakers and multiple mikes i wasn't hesitant. I was not surprised at all as it lived upto my expectations and to some extent exceeded them. The speakers are much louder and better as compared to the earlier generation and may be the listening capacity is also better. To top all this they have also made it much better looking with the fabric finish on the sides.,5.0
2096,"Got it two day back all new Eco dot 3rd generation. Need to say its superb device.
Superb Sound. I was thinking to buy  bluetooth speaker for eco dot thinking that it may not have enough sound and quality. But thanks to Amazon, did superb Job.
It has four mic and listen your commands very well from far away  and i can say it is picking command nicley from approx each corner of say 450-500 square feet room.
It has max volume to 10 level and able to listen upto 6-7 level of music. In high volume, little difficult to listen your voice which is due to high volume of music. But if you are sitting close to Device, you can use button on device to give command.
Nice and Compact Design as well.
Tried doing few activity like plying music, adding task, adding reminders, weather forcast, news etc . All done nicley.
Two great thing I like about is that device very well recognise the voice and you can do next song, fast forward, adding song to favorite list, like or dislike the songs, create play list. And second thing is like adding activities to task and adding reminders, actually in normal course, or doing some activity, you sometime remember something or want to add something to to-do list or say monthly shopping list, but what happened when you sit to prepare that list of stuff you need ot task to do, you forget that stuff or activity. With the help of this device, you can add that stuff immediately when it get  striked to you so that at last moment you need not spend time on remember that stuff.
Lastly need to say, it can be a superb personal assistant.
Ill rate 4.5 Stars, next update on eco dot , amazon can think of wireless Eco Dot, so we can carry here and there. Currently user need to place it always near power point, which may not be the desired location and second improvement i recommend is to have wall hanging/ wall mount option. Because I personally want to hang in middle between my bedroom and drawing room so that i can gibe command from either side. Third Improvement can be wireless charging. These three improvement make it must buy although still its a must buy.
Superb Job Amazon.",5.0
2097,"I had IR controlled devices in my house. I installed echo Dot and Oakter controller and achieved infinite control of my home devices. Now I just call out, "" Alexa switch on light one and my light comes on"". It's easy to install. You get held up during installation but Amazon has given explanations for specific problems. Plus there is some thing called skill set which gives the eco dot infinite skills. I was able to cast music from my echo dot to my hometheater by blue tooth. Although I can do it by the line out. But I was interested in doing that by Bluetooth",5.0
2098,"Amazon Echo dot (3rd Gen) really rocks:
The following are the pro's and con's:
1. The 4 mics are very sensitive and is picking up the voice commands even from my 3 yr old daughter without any glitch and even from a far distance, my entire family is enjoying a lot. You just name it, and Alexa in echo dot is ready with the answers. The accuracy of the answers range between ~80 to 100%.
2. The sound output is crystal clear with all the high notes, mid range and even the low notes (bass) equally balanced and is just awesome to listen to music.
3. Connecting to WiFi network is as easy as a knife through a butter, but connecting to your own mobiles WiFi hotspot is really a bit cumbersome as another mobile with WiFi hotspot is needed only if you are unable to connect echo dot to any WiFi networks during first installation as echo dot gets an update (updates regarding the mobile hotspot) as soon as you connect to WiFi network for the first time.
4. The Bluetooth can easily be setup by the ""Pair"" voice command.
5. The output from the 3.5mm jack is also awesome when connected to an external speakers with amplifier.
A must in every house. I'll update the review after a week of usage.",5.0
2099,"As an Alexa equipped Personal Assistant , Amazon Dot is incredible. I am using Siri in my iPhone and Cortana in my Windows Desktop. Compared with them, Alexa is far better. It gives crisp answers in multiple sentences and not one cryptic line. For example, ask her about the weather and she tells you about the weather in many sentences - temperature, humidity and the probability of rain. When asked the same question in Siri or Cortana - they say only the temperature - at least in my case.
The Bluetooth Speaker barely consumes about 3 W and the consumption rises when used at high volumes. It is crystal clear. The only crib is its Bass response is a shade poorer. Not much of an issue as it uses a tiny speaker. So don't expect a rich full blooded sound from it.
I am using this to control Sonoff Wifi Switches for my Home automation and it is wonderful to control all your devices with just your voice.
At the end of the day, it is money well spent over a useful gadget.",5.0
2100,"I was in doubt while choosing between Google home mini and Echo dot but my inclination towards Amazon as a prime member and my investment into Amazon eco-system made me convinced that I should choose alexa over the other.
Packaging was very good and it contained the Echo dot and and its proprietary charger.
The Echo dot is built well with its mesh fabric design which looks good. It has volume up/down, set-up button with a nifty mute button. It has an ever convenient aux port for connecting to audio system which itself is a reason for my purchase. It can also connect with Bluetooth.
Set-up was easy with the Alexa app and there a plethora of skills to try out.
Sound was warm and the volume could be room filling. As expected there isn't enough bass but other than that the sound is good. Voice recognition is good and it may miss low voices. The Alexa voice is itself is like a person which is good and adds a personality to it. It can sometimes give very witty contextual answers. It's best used with Amazon products and generally good. Home automation is an area where it has an edge as most of the smart home products are Alexa compatible and generally speaking Alexa is best suited for Indian scene. I can stream high quality music from Amazon music being a prime member to my sound system and have added convenience of a smart speaker. You can find good deals and bundles at festivities if you are planning to purchase it.",5.0

2103,"It’s an amazing product to have, especially the integration with your google calendar and tons of skills to play around with. Though hoping there will be more better software updates, but
It’s a bang on product for the price. Bought wipro bulb and echo dot together for 2449Rs and then returned the wipro bulb and got back 700Rs. So got the Alexa for just 1750Rs, which is truely a bang on for a smart assistant and a Bluetooth speaker ;)",5.0
2104,"I will first give the steps to connect succesfully; for a brief general performance review, you may scroll down please.

To successfully pair your phone, wifi and echo:
1. Plug your echo on and download alexa on your phone.

2. From the alexa app, pair your phone with your echo device first to establish the first connection between your phone and your echo.

3. We need to set up wifi access on echo so that alexa on echo can be alive. To do that, after you've paired your echo with your phone, proceed to where you can search for the available wifi networks. Connect to your wifi network on alexa app by entering your wifi password. Post this, your echo should be connected to wifi and alexa on your echo should be online.

4. You can pair alexa with any bluetooth speakers if you have any. You may also pair your phone with your echo with bluetooth so that you may play your local AV via your echo. Yes you can play music from phone. To connect to bluetooth, enable pairing on your echo. To do that, command, 'Alexa pair' and you should hear alexa respond. When she does that, she is ready to pair; open your phone's bluetooth settings and connect to your echo. The connection should now be successful.

5. Develop skills for alexa and keep interracting with her so that your relationship blooms. Any relationships are funny to understand at the beggining. Believe me, there is a deep meaning and truth in my previous sentence.

As for the performance part, there's no compromise from my point of view and your echo dot can easily compete with most advanced dedicated speakers of its size.
The bass is pretty decent. The treble is at a good feel as well. At full volume, there is no screeching or dampening. The sound is premium than previous echo dot.
Echo plus will obviosuly nail it, way better than dot, so please do not compare plus with dot. Both peform exceptionally based on budget.
You cannot wire in audio to your echo dot (nevertheless, you can bluetooth in your audio), but you can wire out to external speakers. When wiring to your external speakers maintain 15cms for optimal performance.

I hope this helps. Peace'o & cheerios folks :)",5.0

2106,"Pre ordered the item and was delivered by Sunday. If the packing was impressive by Amazon, the setting up Alexa was even more. Very easy to set up and without any hassle-be it WiFi, Bluetooth speakers or operate smart gadgets.Understands Indian English without any problem and answers anything from science mathematics politics countries etc referring Wikipedia. Plays so many songs from Amazon Music as well as from Saavan. I was stunned to hear soundtrack version of old ones like Sound of Music , Abba to latest Lady Gaga. About Hindi....wow any song from Md Rafi, Kishore to latest. Plays any online FM radio in Tune in in all Indian languages and English. Right now it can translate English to Hindi or any international language. May be more Indian languages added soon.I was shocked with joy when Alexa was able to tell the Malayalam movie running in Chennai with PVR multiplex name when asked to name the Malayalm movie running in Chennai.I tried different Bluetooth speakers like Bose Boat or Philips and pairs like a charm.Create your play list in Amazon Music or Saavan and play. Regarding the placement of Echo, try keeping a little above from the floor . It will enhance the bass several times and also fill the room to sound great. Please see my photo for that.

2107,"I was pretty confused between google home mini and this one. So decided to give it a try first.

I planned to return it back once I feel like I am not that impress. But guess what, once I had hands-on, I felt like I am never gonna find any con here. I just configured everything and started using it right there.

Topmost and most imp - Music quality is highly impressive. I am already done with those excessive bassy audio equipment that I have in my home - Sony 5.1 Home theatre and a jbl charge 2+.
Bass is cool but its not so cool when it comes to playing music all day long. And this echo dot fulfilled the purpose. Bass is pretty decent and mids and highs are quite crisp. It clearly sounds like some expensive device. Besides, it plays by itself. so your phone doesnt stay occupied.

It is smart enough in thousands of skills that now I dont have a second thought of returning it.
I purchased wipro bulb combo at 2300.
One of the best feature here is broadcasting. I dont like making phone calls once I am outside. Alexa app allows me to type a broadcast message and send it to my home just with few clicks.
Futuere is here guys. Give it a try. All good so far.",5.0
2108,"The speaker was larger than I thought it would be, a bit chunky but not too heavy. It doesn't move about, because it's nicely weighted, even if played at full volume though I believe 50-60% volume would be enough for most people. The sound is very good indeed. The Bollywood and dance songs play great and even the rock and metal songs are enjoyable. The bass is not very heavy but the sound seems weighted nice for bass heavy songs. Alexa makes it so easy to do so many things, especially if you have smart appliances and lights and all at home which are compatible. Sone things I find enjoyable are asking Alexa to turn on the tv via my smart plug and play a particular show on the fire tv stick and by the time I get to the living room everything's on and the show's about to start. You can even use it to call your family to dinner if you have two or more echo speakers. Some privacy issues are there but it's up to you how comfortable you are giving up some for the convenience it provides. Playing music, the news, weather updates, traffic updates, reading your Kindle library books to you, the possibilities are endless. Spotify too is very nicely integrated with Alexa. The only downside is that the Google feud means there's no YouTube or YouTube music support officially and you have to run through some hoops to get it working (P.S. look up Paul Hibbert on YouTube [oh the irony]). P.P.S.-Amit Bachchan's voice is now available via Amitji keyword but unfortunately you have to pay extra for it :)",5.0

2110,"Well I bought Alexa on 19th May and writing this review on 19 th June.. so far my experience with Alexa is as below .
All-new Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart speaker with Alexa (White) : Echo Dot is awesome, it is batter then Google Home in terms of connecting your Smart TV. It is even batter in understanding your requirement. Pros and Cons as per my 30 days usage along with Google Home is as below.
Pros.
1) Looks very decent
2) Buttons are on TOP so you will not press any button mistakenly while moving your eco dot.
3) Lights are on side and in all direction, so it is easy to view that Eco dot is taking your command.
4) As per my observation, Speaker and Mike are not the same, as It takes your command from quite a distance even though speaker volume is set to 3 or 4.
5) You can give command from almost 10 feet with your normal voice, you need not to shout or need not to raise your voice to give command
6) Connect Smart TV very easily ( I have connected my SONY Bravia 55'' X8200 E Smart TV )
7) You can change volume and change Channels by simply saying channel number or name "" Alexa change channel to Star Movies HD "" or "" Alexa Next channel"" or Alexa change channel to 251"" and ""Alexa increase / Decrease volume to 50% on my TV"" ""Alexa Switch on my TV"", "" Alexa Switch off my TV""
8) Sound quality is very good.
9) You can connect external home theater speakers with it with help of RCA adapter cable.
10) Can pronounce your name in Indian Accent
11) It has a very good collection of songs, so you can enjoy the songs as per your mood and day night situations.
12) It was not understanding hindi before but now Alexa can understand little hindi too.
13) Last but not least, It gives detailed answer for your questions or queries or it can tell even your horoscope or your favorite recipe, It can play radio FM, distance, book cab, book Food, add things to your Amazon cart and many more.. and More...

Cons.
1) It has a room of improvement
2) Still baby and learning many things, so don't expect answer for all your questions
3) Still can do very limited after connected to Smart TV, it can not open Applications like you tube or Sony liv, Hotstar, Zee5. So you have to depend on your TV remote for this.
4) The biggest limitation is, It has to be connected to power plug and socket, you can not take it in your CAR ( You can take Google home in your car or you can connect Google home anywhere as Google home has power connector same as Mobile phones)
5) It can not understand many Indian words, like I tried "" Alexa Riston me darar aai by Jagjit singh ) it never understood it while Google home can even understand one word like "" Hey Google riston me darar aai""
6) You still can not call on mobile, can't send SMS.",5.0
2111,"This is unfair. You make people buy at higher prices and then bring in a special price for two days wherein you discount it heavily with an add on product for free. I paid 2800 Approx for just the Echo Dot, after waiting for a discounted price like the one in January wherein I received Echodot with Oakter. Now ofcourse at 2299/- you are offering echodot with light bulb, which beats both the purchases made by me.

2113,"I was quite confused between echo dot 3rd & 4th Gen so bought both to try and after testing, I choose 3rd Gen bcoz of following reasons.
1. Very responsive to voice command in comparison to 4th Gen.
2. Only 1-1.5 scale down from 4th Gen in sound and bass quality.
3. I prefer 3rd Gen hockey puck design than 4th Gen round shape (personal preference).
4. For higher audio quality and output one can always use external speakers via aux cable.
5. Can integrate with Google even via bluetooth.
6. Easy to place anywhere without any scope of rolling off.
7. LED ring light looks distinctive on top than bottom (4th Gen) bcoz one can't see its 360° view.
8. Plays soft music prity well than hard.
9. Can fit into confined space.
10. Also paid only ₹1999.

2114,What an amazing product? A must have for all home. Spend some more money in the smart home accessories and you can use its full power.

Don't know about Home assistance, didn't try but didn't work to call or message on any number. Whom you are calling need to be added with your Alexa Profile. Of course you won't give access to outsiders. It's only use for family members only. So it's not useful that much.

2117,"One of my best purchases so far from Amazon . I purchased this product after going through a lot of reviews and researches . At one point is was almost convinced to buy the Google Home mini ,but eventual decided to buy the Amazon Echo dot 3rd Gen , after finding out that it has modified itself to understand Indian ascent. So here are the pros and cons after 1 month of usage

PROS-
Smooth Installation
Get the Alexa app at your cell phone and installation is smooth and easy
Connecting to the wifi is ok - at first it took a while , but then it was smooth
Connecting to a blue tooth device is really fast
Lovely sound quality and is decent enough for a big sized room.
Can play almost any song (i tried , hindi , eng and of course being a Bong i tried all sorts of Bengali songs)
Yes it plays maximum songs from Amazon Music , and then goes to Sawan or other music libraries too.
Language can be set as English and Hindi
One can set reminders , play quiz, it can make animal sounds , ask about weather conditions and forecast , in fact it can answer most of your queries .(its a best fried of my 1 year old son)
If you have a smart light , you can even set to turn on/off the light (in my case i got the Wipro smart led bundled as free)

CONS
Have to admit that the search option has to be updated a little , in case of little difficult things it cant search its library and ans
Cant play songs from YouTube (obviously copyright issue )
Its always plug and play , it doesn't have a battery . Makes it a little difficult to carry , cos it requires electric plug-ins (unlike portable Bluetooth speakers )

over all its a great buy , barring few negative things which obviously can be ignored
and what makes it more amazing is that i got it at 40% discount during the GREAT INDIAN FESTIVAL",5.0

2119,"At first i was confused which one to buy - Google home mini or Echo dot. After considering few factors I decided to buy this echo dot 3rd gen.

Pros:

1) Sound quality and volume has improved a lot from previous gen.
2) Alexa and Amazon services are more integrated with Indian market which the Google lacks. For example I can book uber cab,order food in zomato,order things from Amazon without even taking out my smartphone.
3) It can used as a smart speaker,Bluetooth speaker and also it has 3.5 mm headphone jack.
4) Amazon prime membership at Rs 999 per year is the most value for money subscription. You can stream in Amazon prime video, music from prime music, become an Amazon prime member, free kindle e books and many more.Google takes monthly Rs 99 for songs only.
5) You can control smart lights and electronics from Philips, Xiaomi, Yeelight and other Alexa compatible devices.

Cons:

1) Let me be honest,Alexa can never beat Google assistant, Never(That's why I gave 4 stars)
2) It has to be kept plugged in all the time,not battery powered (same is the case with Google home)
So if you are looking for a smarter assistant to interact with, Google home is your choice. For all other uses Amazon echo speakers are better.",4.0
2120,"Verdict
-While the previous Echo Dots were cheap ways to extend smart home control all over your home, they weren't the most attractive devices and had weedy sounds. Bought it on tha second day of Prime day in a combo
-The Amazon Echo Dot (3rd Gen) as a vast improvement on the originals, even though it costs exactly the same.
-The new finish looks fantastic and the new Echo Dot is a device that you'd happily put out on show. Audio has been dramatically improved, too, both in terms of quality and loudness, which makes Alexa easier to understand and means that the odd bit of music or radio is a possibility.
-If you're looking to put Alexa in more rooms, then this is the device to buy.

Pros
-Clear and loud audio
-3.5mm and Bluetooth audio outputs
-Same price as old model
-Improved design

Cons
-No longer USB-powered
-Not ideal for music",4.0
2121,"First of all don't even compare it to google dot. That thing will take ages to catch up to the tailor-made experience of Amazon echo dot for India.
Now being a smart speaker this thing is not like a regular bluetooth speaker which is used to play your music but it's an interactive device which works on your voice command(or the app). Playing music is just one of its features and it can do a lot of other things for you. Infact it's learning to do new skills everyday. You can control your electronics (lights, t.v., or any other device connected to smart plug) , set up cameras, play games, quizzes, order food, do calculations, listen to radio, ask the questions of general knowledge or any other random information that you want.
The sound is more than perfect for a mid size room but you can always connect it to another speaker. I have connected mine to the UE Boom 2 and the resulting sound quality is just amazing.
It obviously takes time and investment to reap all the benefits of this tiny device but for sure this little dot will change the way you live in an amazing way.",4.0
2122,"Amazon Echo Dot ticks all the boxes, except it's sound quality. It's extremely powerful, smart and agile. The effort by the engineer's at Amazon shows. They have done a painstaking job to perfect Alexa. Microphones are powerful (Alexa even acted upon a request to play party music from a TV commercial!!). The sound quality needs to be worked upon. It's just not there. Considering that most of my requests are to play music, it needs to be crystal clear. It's not that small speakers can't sound good. JBL, for instance, sounds great even in its basic version. I had to invest in an extra Bluetooth speaker to make up the deficiency on the sound quality front ( Ultimate Ears Wonderboom costing Rs 4 k). Incidentally, I had a tough time searching for a compatible Bluetooth speaker as Amazon has not released any list of Echo Dot compatible speakers. I had made a call to Echo support and even the support executive could not help me. Finally after two cancellations, I hit upon Wonderboom, which is terrific with the Echo Dot.",4.0
2123,"Alexa vs Google home

Alexa has a very good speakers.
Google has a average speakers.

Alexa can recognize voice from anywhere in the corner of a 1600 sq ft house.
Google finds it difficult in one go. Need multiple attempt.

Alexa can play exactly the same music you ask for since it plays from Amazon music.
Google home can be linked with spotify, you tube music and multiple songs app so it plays which is easy for it😃.

Alexa can catch exact voice and words.
Google takes multiple attempt.

Both needs power connectivity all the time when you use.

Both works on same concepts.

Google home is better option only cause it connects YouTube. Youtube premium is not needed.

Alexa is a better option if you are ok with the contents of Amazon music and other apps except YouTube.",4.0

It has a really good voice range in both senses- the speaker in its full is pretty powerful plus Alexa manages to hear you even from the next room. Not good with regional languages though. Still learning i guess. Plus sometimes shows some glitches in responding especially if you are requesting something like a hindi song and can sometimes not tell you the desired information. But that hapoens rarely. Overall, happy with the device after 10 days of usage.",4.0

I was confused with nest and this because both are selling at almost same price but sound wise this one is much better and if you're confused with digital clokc or 4th generation then my suggestion is no need to spend more than 2500₹ on this devices after sometime you hardly use them or spot any difference from highend version .",4.0

2129,"I read a number of reviews where people trying to connect it to their phone hotspot are not able to. The solution is to in reading the instructions carefully. If you want to connect to a hotspot don't select the phones WiFi network during setup on alexa app. There is a separate option at the bottom (where the wifi networks are listed) to connect to the phone hotspot. Next, in the hotspot settings of your phone check that you have allowed unknown devices to connect. For example, in Samsung phones by default it allows only known devices to be connect to the the hotspot. Turn off the setting and Echo will connect to the phones hotspot. I have two wifi networks configured for my echo. If my first network goes down, Echo switches to my phone hotspot easily. Just read the setup instructions carefully.

I bought it for automation and multiroom music streaming. It fulfills the purpose to a large extent. However, I feel that Amazon should have given more granular control of volume. The 10 level volume doesn't give you much control and sometimes going from (say) level 7 to level 8 is too much of a jump. Secondly, the volume of alexa and the connected speaker doesn't sync. Each has to be adjusted independently. In Samsung phones you have the option to bind the phone volume and speaker volume. This sort of function should be there. Apart from this, the third party development and support for the connectedness devices is excellent and I feel it'll trump Google home in some time. That ways I can see it as a much more future proof bet.",4.0
2130,"We purchased Gen3. The voice of assistance is too heavy. No equalizer settings. App has a very poor design and functionality. Sound of music is rich, but very poor in high frequency (treble), bass is good as per the size of speaker. Overall, good to hear music. AI is just okay, has very limited AI features, Mobile's Google voice is way more intelligent in answering questions. Good for wakeup alarms and listening music. Apps like spotify is very poor as opposed to Advertisement shown. Youtube selects better song lists rather than Amazon's music or Spotify. Gaana is still better, but way behind Youtube. Crux: If you have a small and good quality speaker system, just pair with your mobile and it shall be better; more better if use an old phone as no sms & phones shall disturb. These smart speakers are always listening (except for mute) ... always leaves me in doubt.",4.0
2131,"So I wanted a device to control my smart home devices via my voice so I bought the echo do, I got a really good deal as I paid just 3.6k for it (The actual retail price is 4.5k).
So i v already owned an Alexa for a while .
And there are a lot of things that it can do but it also lacks in some places .

Pro's:
1. Works great with automation and wifi devices (switches , light etc).
2.pretty loud for the sound .
3.mic's are great can pic the sound really well.
4.robust design .
5.can perform tasks related to amazon and some other apps like zomato , ola , ndtv , aajtak , saavan and a few more .

Cons:
1. Cannot play music from spotify , although Spotify is now in india the echo dot doesn't support it in India it ll say that Spotify is not available in your region.
2.cannot do Google related tasks , for example if I ask it for the ""price of Hayabusa"" it search's for Hayabusa on amazon and tell me the price of random toys , has issue with SEARCHING for stuff.
3. Lacks a lot of voice features and has some glithes like when u tell it to start stopwatch it asks me for alarm .
4. Heats up a bit on the top .
5.wifi coverage isn't the best .
Well If you are looking for good sound and not so many voice features then echo dot is for you , but if u want to person searches and play music on Spotify then I feel google home is a better option.
Alexa can get better in the future but for now it lacks quite a lot of features",4.0
2132,"Overall good product. With double offer it was reasonably priced. Good voice recognition. The sound and it's quality could have been slightly better. However I feel only people with Amazon prime will benefit from the Amazon music. Otherwise I'm not aware of any other way of listening to music as of now. Pandora is not available in India. It may play from web? Not sure of that.There is an option on asking for a radio station where it tunes and plays songs from it. Did not try and the video was American. Voice recognition is spot on. With Amazon prime there is option to shop online through alexa, good list of songs such that u can say a song name or artist and Alexa will play. Intelligent enough ai that I felt like iron Man talking to Jarvis.",4.0
2133,"Upgraded from 2nd to 3rd Gen dot, must say the sound quality has improved phenomenally. While the previous gen dot was more of an ""Echo Input"" type functionality, this one can actually serve as a decent speaker. Coming to the software side:
1. Apple music not supported in India. In fact the only available services are Amazon music, Saavn and Hungama music
2. Amazon music has a very limited catalog and Indian users can't upload their songs either ( apparently US users can do this)
3. Spotify not available ""yet""
4. Youtube/ Google play music not supported for obvious reasons
5. Because of the above I tried to give Saavn a shot as their catalog is surprisingly large, but then Alexa doesn't support playlists for Saavn.

Summary:
If you are planning to get an Echo for listening music - stay away from this (or any Echo device for that matter) - at least for now.",4.0
2134,"If you’re in the market for a cheap wireless speaker that can make calls, control your smart home and play the occasional song or two, the Amazon Echo Dot is easily one of the best smart speakers on the market for you – even better than the Google Home Mini in terms of call quality and music playback.",4.0
2135,"Hello,
I purchased this from somewhere else.. After using it for a while, i noticed the amazon music service doesn't work at all. I was under the impression that amazon music, which is freely available with echo devices would work. After trying for hours to make it work i gave up, Alexa replied that ""She couldn't find anything"" whenever i tried to play something on amazon music. The only service that works good so far is Hungama Music. I am saying this after testing all the other services like Gaana, JioSaavn, Spotify etc... Gaana works as well but it has some issues... Spotify also works but lacks many songs.

Aside from that, the mics are good but only till the volume medium, because high volume makes the device hard to hear us. Anything over volume level 6 is bad, and Alexa won't hear us unless we shout at her. I really liked the 2nd gen which had 7 mics yet this one only offers 4.. which is a downside for me. Hardware wise the sound quality is good until the volume level 8, but anything over that makes the sound distort and would be a pain to hear it.

Alexa is on the other hand is good to talk to, she (It) can play music, tell jokes, read stories, sing songs, set alarms, set reminders, control smart devices etc... with the bonus of human like speech. This was the factor made me buy this. But on the downside she lacks too much intelligence compared to her counter part Google assistant.. She can't even answer the basic questions and just forwards us to Wikipedia. I hope amazon continues to improve Alexa.

So as a new buyer which one to buy? Alexa or Google
If you don't care about how the assistant speaks, (robotic speech vs human like speech) then go for Google assistant speaker. Because Google and Alexa devices can both can do the job for smart homes. But Google uses their vast database infrastructure for information so obviously it will have upper hand in this department.

But if you care about how your speaker speaks then go for Alexa.. without thinking anything.
If you care about information then go for Google assistant else Alexa should be your preference.",4.0

when it comes to device,
not that smart. Alexa is not very friendly some times. Does not answer all my queries. and Alexa is not letting me emotionally attached to her. ""Alexa, will you be with me forever"" -> ""Alexa: I don't know that one"" :(

 $$$ Awesome Bluetooth Speaker with AI.Value for money ,got it during sale of Rs2999/-. Playing songs via JioSavan and Gaana app and sound that comes out from this Small echo dot 3rd Gen 🔊 was Bombastic for a small room , but playing songs through Mobile via Bluetooth is not giving that much of clear sound of songs some sort of Treble sound is missing but awesome with Gaan app and Jiosaavan app. Regarding Amazon Alexa AI sometimes not triggered I have to say 2X or 3X Alexa then Alexa respond to our voice , I think Amazon have to continue to Use concept of 7 microphones instead of 4 microphone which was in Echo dot 2nd Generation. Negative part of this Echo dot 3rd is it has circular plugin port to echo dot which should be usb 2.0 which 2nd Gen echo dot have plus point here. I think Amazon should change this Power Plugin port to normal USB 2.0 so that we can connect our Smartphone charger cables to it and connect it to any Power bank. One Con is that anyone who knows how to trigger Alexa in your absence your neighbours and their children's can operate Alexa to play something or if you have smart plugs connected to Alex a theybeasily can turn On and turn Off lights.",4.0

2146,Used this device for about a couple days now and so far I've observed it can play any English song you ask pretty easy but when asked about a hindi song it either plays a wrong song or it can't understand. Hence asked Alexa to change her language to indian English and Hindi. Now the accent and voice is of a Indian lady and not the original US English accent but still face difficulty in getting it to play the hindi songs I request. But I guess it will learn to recognise my words slowly. Although it's a wonderful device with many uses but it needs to work on getting the right hindi songs.,4.0
2147,"I have always been a fan of virtual assistants. So when there was amazing offer which gave me e the echo dot along with the syska smart bulb for under 3000 rupees I went for it. Initial impressions it works as advertised however I am not sure if the one or two times I use this on a daily basis to turn off the light it is worth the amount I paid. Is not anything else it works as a smart speaker and you can tell Alexa to play songs at the convince of your voice. It's want to talk to Alexa and laugh at funny responses. Alexa isn't as smart as you want it to be and a lot of you questions are responded with ""I don't know that"".

If your locality has a lot of power outages it might be a problem specially sense Alexa takes about a couple of minutes to reconnect if it loses power. It also will not work if you don't have an active internet connection which is a huge bummer. But overall I'm very happy with the purchase and I would recommend others to give it a try as well.

It doesn't recognise voice even after activating it many times.
After command it doesn't follow.
Disconnects and reconnects network by itself.

(Original review) Disappointed with 3rd Gen ... Switched back to old Echo Dot
I was very happy with Echo Dot old version plastic black one with only concern being speaker volume is limited. Brought this one 3rd Gen and found its voice recognition to be very bad than its predecessor. Often I had to shout to make it listen giving rise to a lot of nuisance to others around and throat pain.

There were things I demonstrated him about alexa like jungle quiz, panchtantra ki kahaniya, alexa laugh, beatbox, fart! Etc. But after one month of use he lost interest in it and being powered from socket I am also not interested to use it as a bluetooth speaker. I configured it to control a wipro smart bulb. But after few days I started using the smart bulb as a regular bulb because it's easier to press the physical switch compared to checking the configuration & connection everytime ""Alexa Bulb on"" or ""Alexa bulb off"" voice command doesn't work. So now it is kept idle since 3 months and will remain so for many more months/years to come.

-What I like About This Product.
1. Built Quality is perfect and strong.
2. Sound Quality with balanced bass.
3. Super Voice Detection thanks to 4 Inbuilt mic.
4. Fast Bluetooth connectivity and sync. Process.
5. Calling through Alexa is super fun and easy.
6. Cristal clear voice quality.
7. 3.5mm Audio Jack is again + for this product.
8. Best ecosystem for smart home control.
9. Perfectly work with all Alexa enabled device.
10. Multiple Alarm, Reminder, To-Do List works perfect.
11. Alexa calling is super fun and I really enjoyed this features subject to the other person having account in Alexa.
12. Can create shopping list for you. But can not tell deals and promotions, so be careful and check the offers before placing the order.

What I don't like.
1. Not answer all the questions correctly.
2. Only support English language.
3. Get stuck after turning it on after a long break and I have re-start the device to make connection again which irritate a lot.
4. Answer is not as clear at Google Home mini.
5. Listen only clear english, so if you are Not Good in English then Alexa will irritate you a lot.

2162,"Alexa - Good initiative, but lack of knowledge🧐 need more improvement in AI😴.

Usage - It connects with your phone easily, it could recognise your voice easily. But it can only answer very easy and familier queations. Appart from that it will always say like ""sorry I don't know that one""😵. And each time you need to start conversations by saying Alexa, then only it will start recognise your commend. Within few minutes you will get a headache🤕.

Music - When you say Alexa play music, their will play music from Hungama app. Very less collection is there. Especially Tamil songs are very very less. And mostly Alexa not playing the song which you ask. It will play on it's won. 🥴

2166,"This review is for the Echo dot (3rd gen).

On the Hardware front, the device is quite good(maybe best in the market) at this price, only one thing I would want it to have is a battery inside as you have to connect it to a power source always, which makes it less portable and for scenarios when there is an electricity cut (well we live in India-a developing country, here many areas even in the top cities don't have 24 hrs of electricity, Amazon would have considered this)

The software front is just average.
If you have used google assistant(Ok Google) on mobile/any device then you can think as Alexa answers just around 50% efficiently compared to google assistant (according to me). Alexa doesn't understand follow-ups like google assistant, every time you have to say ""Alexa"" first for everything, and it also doesn't understand many basic questions (like what are the flights from Jaipur to Delhi?, who played most IPL matches?-->it just says I don't know the answer), you have to be more specific in framing your query for Alexa, it is also not as good as google assistant with the Hindi language. Google Assistant is much more friendly than Alexa, with all that said I would say Alexa is about Half as smart as Google assistant.
Only one thing good on the software front is it has the biggest Skills' library so you can automate/routine many things.

On the last note, I would say this device is good to control smart devices in your home(like smart bulbs, plugs, appliances, etc), doing routine stuff like reordering regular things on Amazon(like grocery, etc), reorder foods, book cabs, etc. and obviously to listen to music online.

I never own any google smart speaker, but with my research, I think Echo dot(3rd gen) is better on the hardware front and google nest mini(2nd gen) is better on the software front, well, it depends on you which to choose.",3.0

* Smart devices most of them only supports 2.4Ghz wifi router
* Smart devices cost a lot as compare to normal electronics, with this speaker u need to spend extra bucks to make your home more smarter

-ves: It generally plays music from Amazon music library. THE SOUND QUALITY IS NOT THAT GOOD. Sounds like 19th century radio. It works only when Wifi and Electricity are available.
I am keeping it for the novelty and as a sample of future AI. Would be happy if it lasted atleast till 2022 Diwali😜",3.0
2171,"I have been using the Alexa for about a month now. Following are the reasons for buying or not buying it:

Why buy Alexa?
-New tech, voice assistant feels you powerful.
-Good acoustics. You can hear the songs from anywhere around your home.
-Good for engineering purpose. You may hack it for your own bespoke purpose, for IOT applications.
-Amazing new tech.

Why I don't recommend buying Alexa?
-It works wobbly when it comes to giving voice commands in between an ongoing music or action.
-Does not work with Google Maps.
-Serch engine is poor and limited too.
-More expensive than it's counterpart, Google Home Mini.",3.0
2172,"Hi Future buyer,
Planning to buy this device wud be highly not recommended if u r a noob to this and in case u r running a custom rom on your andriod device.
The App is confusing as much as it can be and force closes if u r not on factory OS, neither will there be any help or nor any reply to your mails from the developer, The setup dint go well and took me to register the product from web based registration.
Otherwise the Product build quality is excellent when compared to the previous one and sound quality is amazing in the new one, Non the less Google home mini still has a better speaker but its hard to differentiate having both at my house side by side,
You r also not to be surprised if u find your router to behave funny when both Alexa and Google home mini are side by side, Its like they r fighting for Bandwidth.
The results are quite slow and takes time for reply when compared to G Home mini.

The LED looks damn good at night and kinda adds upto the entire beauty of the product

Overall if u r someone with good skill set on these things and just want to showoff ur house go for it I wud recommend to buy, others if u r a nood ( Fresher ) go for google home your life will be easy",3.0

2174,"The right review can not be given. I am using mobile internet. Jio and Airtel are used. But, their internet connectivity and strength are questionable. Therefore, the right review can not be given. However, for music play, it is really attractive and interesting. However, Alexa has to learn a lot before getting five stars. Secondly, Alexa understands English. There are many other features which are not understood by a general user. Thirdly, in order to make a smart home and make Alexa a hub of such a home requires a lot of money. Those features can only be placed under the review when they are arranged.
However, even then, I will recommend to buy it. For 4000 rupees you get good music and less botheration provided the internet strength remain consistence. I feel discouraged when the red line rotates on the device. Even then, buy it and make it a part of your setup.",3.0
2175,"1. Size is small, Looks good in home, material is good
2. It can fill your entire room with good volume of music. Volume vs size of device is really good.
3. Alexa sound is mechanical, we're still 3-4 years earlier for a natural sound of robot in such devices.
4. Can't expect latest GK questions / smart / complicated 2 sentences combined queries, bcoz results are per google search and google can't put logics in queries yet as it's mostly keyword relevance matching. So, overall experience is still mechanical.
5. Music library it connects to are Saavn and it doesn't have good music for night sleep, it keeps repeating it.
6. It blindly plays what the apps give it to play, like, the mood based music search is not good. It sometimes play songs as per direct matching of lyrics with what we spoke but totally not as per intention at all. Such devices totally needs a smarter search engine which understands intention.

Overall small fun device, but I still feel that such devices will take some years to mature and become truly seamless home assistants. But it's for parents and they like it enough :D",3.0

1. Lots of fun. You can roast your friend by setting simple routine which can be activated by customized voice phrase and it will respond with your customized messages.

2. You can control your TV, FireStick etc but in a limited way.

3. Can ask for time while half asleep...it provides many other simple features and some of them are useful too.

Cons:
1. Doesn't recognize Select, UP, Down and other navigation command. So cannot replace you fire TV remote.

Also it should be connected to atleast 2 Firesticks or 2 TV’s in a single home.. This should be the minimum.

The HORRIBLE:
I'm unable to connect my Spotify account to the device. People in USA can. I'm giving the product 3 stars in place of 5 only because of this flaw. It's big enough a flaw for me to switch to Google Home instead, even if it isn't as good as the Echo in other aspects.",3.0

2190,"As a first gen amazon echo dot owner, i thought these would improve the overall experience. But the first thing i noticed after setting it up was the bad speech recognition, while the first gen heard me 8 out of 10 times l, the newer one heard me only like 6 out of 10 times!, but the worst part is that the first gen actually did a better job of recognizing my commands and was more polished than this! While the first gen gave me enough time for me to speak, these would just cut me off if i stuttered while the command,.. They wont give the beep echo dot first had while changing volume.
Overall the user experience is downgraded while the build and sound quality improved by a good margin! Hope they will just fix these small issues by just cut n pasting the same echo dot first gen experience or just try to even improve on these unnecessary omissions they made!

If they update it, i would give these a easy 5 stars! Great sound, great build, nicely designed,

3.Bluetooth connection with the device very difficult to set up if you have not used it for a while

Although it is overpriced product in my view just because basically for music, news etc. We are spending 4.5 K that really not worth as true price for that product would be 2.5 K considering it's good speakers, echo , bass etc. Its good innovation but it is on developing phase because of following:-
1. As many a times Alexa find difficulties to understand our language
2. Not many options available for exploring in music only ganna and savaan is available.
3. The Amazon Alexa app is the worst, as in case Alexa didn't get the song you are willing to listen, so you can't search that particular song on app
4. There is no voice locking system as anybody can change the music by giving command
5. Works well with WiFi only .

Its kind of very irritating at times. Only my 5yrs old daughter was interested and wide eyed when Alexa spoke. lol

I will start with Cons--
You need to keep it plugged as it has no supportive battery.
You need to keep repeating question like a parrot until Alexa understands
You need to keep adding apps for alexa to function and that too does not work properly
Alexa does not recognise your playlist, Its not programmed that way, So even if your have list full of songs it will not play.
Alexa only knows Savan and Amazon music which has very limited collection of songs.
Now comes for the storytelling and other activities, It keeps repeating the same story and same jokes, same poems. BORING

I don't think the speaker is that great.. the sound emanating from is high on bass, I would have preferred Amazon allowing us to mix the quality preferred by me.. they should have added this feature in Alexa, since it boasts to have the world at your feet.

Today it consumed around 800 MB while I connected it to my hotspot for around 20 mts and played on songs in that time.I have been facing this issue everyday for almost a month now. All of my data is getting exhausted in trying to operate Echo Dot!
2. Unable to process requests - Since last month it has not been taking commands well, and no matter how clearly you command it plays something else most of the times.

I do not know how to contact product service team/Amazon representatives hence mentioning the issue faced here. Hoping to hear back from concerned representatives.

2203,"The feature of Alexa Calling works only with contacts who have the echo devices. In short, you cannot use to call the mobile or phone of your contact list if the other person doesn't own another echo device. This is too absurd and a feature which should be clarified to customers in marketing communication.
The voice recognition and song lists is another area which needs a lot of improvement. Until and unless the song is shared exactly as it is listed with starting words, Alexa doesn't identify it. Also, it does not play My lists in Amazon music. It is a challenge to keep repeating the command with numerous voice modulations and starting point so that Alexa plays the right song. It is a real pain.

Dislike:

1. Sound quality is poor, more often than not you find the sound quality muffled.
2. Volume sometimes feels weak, it should have been a bit higher
3. It can used as a Bluetooth speaker for random song playing from your phone but you can’t use it to listen to audio content like watching an audio clip / series / Netflix etc. in such a scenario the audio is muffled and difficult to comprehend.
4. It’s plays music from Amazon music which lacks variety in its music. We’ll also know it’s nothing like YouTube library
5. Finally, when Alexa doesn’t even understand or comprehend your request, it gets annoying to the next level.
6. Volume is audible in limited space… you’re room for example.

2205,"I seriously hate saying ""Alexa"" now. Voice recognition is the worst thing I have experienced in this device. I just use this in a small 10x10 room and most of the time I have to repeatedly repeat and repeat or even yell ""Alexa"" to wale the device.
I never expected to get such experience from this device after going through ratings and reviews of the device. I was confused between Google Nest Mini and Alexa Echo Dot 3rd Generation and only choose this because of AUX output which was really useful feature but just after few hours since I am using this, I am really frustrated with it. I have tried resetting the device and voice training it but nothing helped. It is placed just 2 feet away on bedside table and no noise but it still won't get the word ""Alexa"" or understand most of the time. I have to always repeat myself and speak louder. Far field microphone feature on the device description says it can hear you from across the room. Seriously!!? It cannot even catch the ""Alexa"" word from 2-3 feet away and if its playing music even on low volume then it won't work at all and I have to yell ""Alexa"" many times from a feet or even closed to make it stop.

Even it's Alexa assistance doesn't get me most of the time and just goes dormant without any response.

Very disappointed with it. Going to return it now.",2.0
2206,"The speaker can't be used as a wireless Bluetooth speaker.

It's AUX interface is an audio in only. So unlike the 2nd gen echo or the echo dot, you can neither transfer the audio to a secondary better speaker nor to any headphone or earphone.

It does not have a battery so it always needs to be powered.

The above are serious shortcomings not anticipated from a newer generation device.

Apart from that, the Alexa integration works pretty well and as expected. However Alexa seems far inferior to Apple Siri when it comes to maintaining the context of a conversation.

Overall a nice buy if you wish to experience a voice enabled product that can get a lot of things done. But perhaps not worth the price given the above observed shortcomings.

2207,"Echo Dot is a good speaker and voice recognition is quite impressive. However, Alexa integration is still in the development phase. So be prepared to get frustrated.

If you are someone who loves the old classics, you will find Alexa very disappointing. And don't forget, you need Amazon Music's premium account to be able to stream music on Echo Dot. That also means, Akexa will play only that music which is available on Amazon Music. I'm not a big fan of Amazon Music. It does not have much of my kind of music.

Alexa also plays from Jio Savn and Hungama. So getting Alexa to play some music is not always a simple task to perform. And a lot of times, you want Alexa to play an album you saw on Amazon Music or Hungama but the voice assistant fails to find it!

I don't have complaints about operating smart appliances with Alexa though. It's totally fun.

Edit-1: It has been five months since I started using Echo Dot and I still can't easily find the music I love. On this Independence Day I tried to get Alexa play some classic patriotic songs like ""Jahaan Daal Par Sone Ki..."" but no matter what words I used, Alexa kept playing a playlist called ""Ai Watan"" which seemed to have all new songs, none of which I liked.

It should not allow anyone to hijack your device- in my case my 7 year old, who keeps fiddling with the reminders or moving it away from a central location to his room. ( don't tell me you can't do voice classification, then at least ask a PIN ). For me the device is useless now, as I may not even hear it and important reminders may get removed.

2. The India model at least has no working profanity filter, my son plans music with profanity and there is no way to restrict access.
3. Searches sometimes fail miserably- it is not recognition, the problem is the content that is being searched for an answer. Google's device is probably is stronger here with search results

2216,"Kind of works, but not enough. Product make and the sound quality are good. Aux-out was a major reason to choose Alexa over G-Home. Basic stuff like alarm/timer etc are okay. But that is it.

Many times the device doesnt listen to me, specially when it is playing music. And I end up calling 'Alexa"" 3-4 times going closer each time to get the 'attention'. If I had to go all the while to the equipment to say 'Next' or 'reduce volume', what is the benefit over any normal music player !
And when it listens, it recognizes wrong atleast half of the time. Initially I thought it is with the regional language (song/movie name), but then found the problem with perfect English dictionary words also (Mercury as Fury and MP3 as MPA). My accent must be really bad !
So basically i have to struggle for minutes to get an intended song played.
I did get the PLEX server setup in my PC to stream local music to alexa. Not at a level of selecting songs with voice commands yet, but atleast I get a playlist of my choice played.

Most of the time I have to use specific commands itself. Natural Language Processing seems far far away. You will need a lot of patience to deal with Alexa !",2.0

The Agent whom I spoke to was Mr. Sami, he was so polite, professional and spoke to for 45 minutes and finally came to know by the agent that the product which I got was reported as stolen or missing product, So that is why I couldn't complete the set up process.

Also if you have multiple internet connection, it cannot save 2 or more internet connections which could be connected when one is not working and this is my main disappointment. I would not comment on sound quality as there are much more products at this price range which has greater sound quality.

Speech recognition is very good, but most of the times it interprets wrong for which song I need.

2231,"Extremely bad experience with Amazon
- Bought this with in combo with fire tv stick and Wipro bulb for 7098 rs. My three previous fire sticks were all for 2600rs during sale instead of 4000rs. This time I was willing to pay 4000 for the stick as echo dot I was getting for 3029 and Wipro bulb for like 100 bucks (699rs otherwise).
- Echo dot ran fine for first 3-4 days then I faced mic issues a few times. I felt could be because of other noises, ceiling fan perhaps.
- I then tried to run specific lists e.g. I went to Amazon music app, saw the playlist I wanted to play. I asked echo dot to play that list from Amazon music. Instead it kept playing random playlists and a few times it mentioned it didn't recognise that list even though it was right there in front of me on the phone.
- I emailed cs for above issue, no response till date. Been 7 days.
- As a workaround, I decided to play music from app rather and then cast it on Echo Dot. It kept showing connecting (blue circle kept rolling) but nothing ever happened. Means cast option also didn't work. Being a techie myself, I performed all tech articles from Google, reset device etc., Checked location, what not. Finally, I rang cs and they perfomed a few troubleshooting which didn't work. They informed I would be contacted in 24-48 hours. I mentioned replacement window ends after 48 hours and I want response by then. Wasn't too keen in going for replacement and trouble people so agreed to wait for 48 hours window.
- to my surprise, it's been 3 days now, no response. I called cs. Was asked to wait for 48 more hours. I asked for supervisor. He came on call and asked me to wait for his team to perform troubleshooting. I had lost it by then. I asked for replacement and after huge hold and verbal discussions to and fro, supervisor agreed for replacement. But informed I'd be informed in a few hours.
- I checked now, I am being issued refund and it cost me 500 rs setback. Whole logic of bundle and save money was absolutely rubbish and Amazon support really destroyed the overall experience.

2240,"Even the best devices can be ruined by poor software and bad UI. This is a classic case of a good device such as the Echo dot 3rd gen let down by horrendous software. In terms of sheer sound quality and ability to hear you across the room, the ED 3rd blows google home mini right out of the water, and... that's where it stops.

I bought it for 2299 and got a wipro bulb free, I figured that it couldn't be a bad purchase. Boy was I wrong!

Let's begin with the Alexa app, whoever is in charge of making that app should be sent back to 2012. Remember when you had no clue whether you tapped on a button or not because the taps weren't highlighted? Remember how everything used to be unresponsive back then? Yeah, that's Alexa app for you. SD 855 and 8gigs of ram on your phone? LoL, Alexa don't care! The layout, the buttons in the app, the navigation, ugh.. takes me back to the 90's. A big zero on ease of use or navigational hierarchy. Forget Grandpa, even millennials would have a hard time with this app!

What about voice recognition? 50% of the time, it does not recognize you every time.

Smartness: The lack of smartness is displayed when you start asking follow up questions. ""Who is the tallest man?"" It'll give you the answer, but if you follow up with ""how tall is he?"". Alexa will go berserk. Heralding a device that can control your lights or turn on the TV as a miraculous achievement is a blatant lie. Controls via commands is nothing new, people in the coding community have done so with raspberry pi's before. What makes it smart is the incousion of AI and machine learning that understands patters and recognizes speech slurs. Something google does and constantly thrives to improve upon.

Microphones: There are 4 and they are good, they can hear you from 10 feet away under normal circumstances. Far better than Goggle home mini.

Connectivity issues: Wuff, this is one of the biggest issues I faced. Connection is not as easy and simple as that 3 slide image says on the description. Turn on Bluetooth, location, wifi, then look at the app for a Echo-something-th8, it didn't show up! Great, now do the manual labour and get it connected. Even after connection you're gonna get ""updating your device for 10 minutes"".

Integration with other smart devices: Wanna connect the wipro bulb with Alexa? First download the wipro smart home app, create an account so that you can be spammed for the rest of your life, then set up that app and device. Next, head over to Alexa, download the wipro skill app for alexa, set it up and congratulations, you can now control lights with latency issues rivaling that of a 56k modem. What's worse, I now have an app on my phone that I only used once in my life but cannot for the love of god uninstall because that stops the bulb from working. VERY SMART!

Music: Wanna listen to music on this speaker from your favorite streaming service? Unless it's Amazon music, Saavn or iTunes, your sh!t our of luck. Even though Spotify launched nearly a year ago, there's no way to get Spotify playing on the device natively unless you change device region to Amerika.

Speed: You can stream Netflix at 4k? That's great, Alexa don't care! Ask a question, go brew a coffee, fix that leaking faucet, sign up for a banking loan and then, only then perhaps you would get your answer. Now that's an exaggeration but when you compare Alexa's speed in terms of genuine questions as opposed to responding to commands like ""turn off the light"", it is the slowest. Google>Siri>Cortana>your neighbor's pigeon >Alexa.

- You need amazon prime account for Rs. 999 per year to listen to music from amazon. Otherwise you will have to use free and full of advertisement services like Saavn, Gaana, etc.
- Echo dot skips to next song abruptly without completing current song most often.
- If you try to stream music from your Amazon Prime Music app on your iPhone to Echo Dot or Echo Dot stereo pair, the app cannot control the music. You cannot scrub music or know which song is playing or move to next music in the playlist. The control magically switches the Alexa app that you need to have on your phone to setup Echo dot.
- You can only stream to stereo pair from Amazon Prime Music App.
- No real support exists for this device. If you call amazon support staff, they will drive you crazy as they know nothing about this product and its features.
- If you want to use it as kids toy, then it is ok to buy it as it can switch on and off lights that are compatible with Alexa.
- Audio quality is very basic. Even a cheap Chinese product sounds better.
- This is really a no no product for music lovers. You better buy either Sony or JBL soundbars with subwoofer for better quality music, though these may cost you beyond INR15k.
- Alexa does not understands most of the commands. Apple Siri is way ahead of Alexa.
- Amazon is not a software and hardware company. Don't expect quality software and hardware from them. You are being used as testers for their experimental products.",1.0

- It does not change the WiFi connection. Tried with 2 different phones Android and IOS, but could not change the WiFi connection.
- The choice of music service is very limited. Just Gaana, Saavn and Amazon Music is available. You cannot configure, change, remove or add other music services. And for some reason the device only uses Gaana and Saavn and never uses Amazon Music.
- The Bluetooth is of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices. But you cannot play music from your phone via Bluetooth on Alexa.
- Like the Bluetooth, the 3.5 mm audio jack is also of Out mode. Means you can play music from Alexa on other devices with AUX cable. But you cannot play music from your phone or small mp3 players via AUX cable on Alexa.
- The Alexa voice command is definitely Not that effective or responsive as it is claimed or advertised.

2256,"Alexa is so stupid, which you’ll realise once you buy it. There are other brand devices that are more intelligent and more useful. For a silly example, you can’t say “Alexa, switch on Bedroom light” at once. Instead, you have to first say “Alexa”, and wait until it responds, and then tell what you want Alexa to do as a separate command. Another example, if you have 2 lights named as “Hall light 1” and “Hall light 2”, and you ask Alexa to switch on “Hall light 1”, most probably Alexa will ask you back “There are multiple devices named Hall light. Which one do you want to switch on?”. That means while talking to Alexa, you’re not allowed to change your mood or tone until the command is complete. Theirs example, if you happen to start asking slowly to Alexa, “Alexa, I want to ask you about...”, immediate Alexa will reply you “Here is what I found on the web about ‘I want to ask you about’”, without even allowing you to complete your question.",1.0

Then executive told me that it seems you've got wrong device, it is meant to cater to US region and soon we'll replace your device with the one meant for India region. I was assured that they'll replace my device but no time-line given. I could see the order in my Amazon order list but today, after almost a month the order was cancelled! So it's a big no from my side if you are planning to buy alexa device!",1.0
2259,"first of all the alexa app itself is around 79MB, the app response is dead slow. i got frustrated by the time it took to move from one screen to next screen. above all echo dot 3rd gene doesn't connect any of my wifi networks throwing the error"" registration failed try again later"" while my amzon fire stick works perfectly with all net works. i am very disappointed with the device , actually so excited to use this as i am a die hard fan of amazon but now i had return it.",1.0
2260,"worst product amazon released into market in a hurry. Here are some, if not all, of the issues:
1 - No sound clarity. Even from 4 feet one cant understand what alexa saying. muffled voice
2 - Limited capability. Other than weather it doesn't know any significant much. I didnt buy it for weather or switch on a bulb.
3 - Dont understand english language properly.
4 -Its useless overall for anything and for anyone, be it kids or adults.
Amazon has a long way to go before it can make it usefull.",1.0
2261,"Wonder if i had a negative scoreing option. Hopeless product. Did everything possible to sync this with my Samsung Smart TV, all in vain. It just does not get connected and keeps asking you for registration every single time you try doing so. Frustration and disappointment, waste of time and efforts. Should have made the interface easier. For now, it's waste of money for all the Samsung smart TV users. Avoid wasting your money.",1.0
2262,"I agree with some reviewers that the software on this ECHO DOT (3rd Generation) is terrible & frustrating. Most instructions are not understood or wrong actions are taken. Most probably factory seconds or rejects of this echo were dumped in India. While the speakers sound good, the speakers on my phone sound better (without the headphones).
Besides I feel most of these voice regognition devices make you a lazy person & a couch potato..so get up exercise switch on & off the lights yourself, walk move & do your own errands..Meanwhile wait for a better Amazon device.",1.0
2263,"The product has intermittent issue while connecting with Phone for playing videos sound. Spoke with Amazon Tech support, they went ahead with raising replacement after some troubleshooting. Now, they picked the device. Though no replacement update. Nothing in the app which indicates that the product has been picked up or replacement has been sent.

Moreover the device itself dont have connectivity with ZOOM app and for calling in India. Though the feature is available in other countries through Echo Connect feature.

Hope they will sent the replacement.",1.0
2264,"This device refused to set up because the Alexa app just didn't work on my mother's phone. I had bought this for her. I even tried signing out of the Alexa app on my phone and then tried logging into her account on my phone and as soon as I would log in, the app would go blank.
I'm still confident that there is nothing wrong with the Echo device but there is a problem in the Alexa app. More specifically there is a problem with my mother's account on the Alexa app. Unfortunately there is no way to fix this or talk to any kind of customer support. Customer support is a chat bot which has a preset list of questions that you need to select. There is no way to get any support for the app.
My suggestion would be to stay away from such 'dumb' smart speakers. Amazon US is very helpful, because the laws in that country require them to be. Amazon in India sucks when it comes to Alexa app support, because there is no way to talk/ chat to someone who can check the account.
Its strange that my worst purchase from Amazon is actually an Amazon product and not something sold by a listed seller.",1.0
2265,"Alexa is horribly wrong and Dumb..I made a mistake by not buying google mini speaker..Alexa has no answers...It is a stupid speaker..I know u need to enable the skills and all that..However, it is still a very bad Assistant..Fully disssatisfied..

Audio quality is good but one can buy a simple bluetooth speaker at 1/3rd the cost rather than messing ur mind up with such an incapable AI speaker.. It cannot answer 90% of your questions.

Used with Fireststick: limited usage and that too with limited apps.Will still need the remote anyway. Not much useful with Firestick.

I strongly suggest please Buy google home mini instead..Audio may be a bit less but the google assistant is amazing..",1.0
2266,"A great device to get started, echo dot is a great device to first know your requirement. Alexa is integrated well enough but the voice recognition will give you trouble in later stages as it fails to recognise simple regular commands after a while, you will only see the blue light which after taking no action will turn off and resume the ongoing task. Many times it will disappoint and embarrass you, can only hope it to get better in future.

Update:
After using it for 1 year i would say it isn't that good of a device, now out of 10 times calling it
out, it wouldd hardly respond twice. May be they have made the 4th gen better in this aspect but this device if you're even getting at a discounted price of 1k, don't bother. Not worth your money.",1.0
2267,"This is useless device.
0) it is not listening command properly. And we have to speak loudly.
1) It is not connecting through Bluetooth to desktop. After a long research and hard setting it is connected and if we would change any song than audio is not coming. I am frustrated.
2) Always need connectivity with internet / Bluetooth to operate any device.
3) not playing music easily wherever we want.
4) don't waste money if don't have 24 hours internet connection and related smart device.
5) from desktop PC it is not connecting from cable and even from Bluetooth adaptor.

So please please don't waste your money on it.

Not a smart device it is useless device.",1.0

 Worst experience with alexa no warranty you get with this product.Amazon policy are worst. Ctdi partner an official amazon devices service partner.
I have requested to Amazon to replace my alexa device with in the warranty period the refuses my request. issue is escalated bu amazon team but no follow up call can be held till today. They are giving fake excuses for service they are temporary un available for service of alexa after few days the warranty get to expire then they say your product warranty has expired so we did not give you a service for your product. “ excuse me amazon all of the world wide companies change their policies in national lockdown.” I think amazon policy are worst. They stand in the last of the top companies list. They have no customer satisfaction. Even apple has extended there warranty of their product in lockdown. Amazon shame Amazon shameful for you",1.0
2269,It doest recognize the voice … it s very difficult …. for playing songs also not getting configured with Ganna app …. even for playing song you have to be specific … secondly just for playing music buying this is not at all recommended. … very poor in aswering the questions …… it even play the news from Outside india .. trie a lot …. returning now,1.0
2270,"Amazon management....Please hire tester, my sincere advise that app developer needs more training. Please trust my words... I almost wasted 12 hours on this worst product which it didn't connect OLED sony 65 inch tv.. called customer care he too spent 2 hours poor guy left advising restart andbtry... Can be build better device/app which can be easily trouble shoot..",1.0
2271,"1 start for not mentioning country of origin.
This product is made in China but while buying in Amazon you can't find it anywhere.
I am not able to return it as my kids open the box and started using it. Later we checked it was made in china.",1.0
2272,"It's malfunctioning. For first two days it worked for, later started to malfunction that includes not stoping the music while playing, not responding to commands properly, for first two days it was working really fine , all of a sudeen it stopped taking commands and more even stopped responding . It had to turn it on and off a couple of times, initially it works fine for one command , later it stops responding. I bought it during Amazon big festive sale, may be I ve been given a defective piece or so !!!!! Very bad ...lost interest on Amazon products !!!",1.0
2273,"Bad software! Alexa is not smart at all.
voice recognition is not accurate most of the times but more than that Alexa interpretation leaves lot to be desired. Alexa is a just NLP and works on plain if else or a switch condition rather than being smart device. No where follows the user pattens, voice patterns and the people to come up with suggestions. Most of the times you get fed up with the results and then switch off the device. Mostly none of the songs I want will be played, I end up using it for casting the music from the phone, which anyways normal Bluetooth speaker will do at a less price.
Hardly any useful tricks as they call it!
Just works as voice command based device rather than a smart speaker!",1.0
2274,"I'm writing this review because Amazon sold us echo dot with syska smart led light and claimed that it will work with alexa but they are wrong, its horrible smart led from syska , very difficult to setup and to connect with your smartphone. There is no support with Amazon alexa for syska smart led .. Amazon misguiding us to sold faulty product with offers. Don't buy it..it will be waste of money and your valuable time.",1.0
2275,"Honestly, please don't buy this product. Better to purchase a Bluetooth speaker and play the songs manually. I bought this with excitement to gift someone, but it didn't work as expected. It was my luck that I tried it first before gifting, & the experience was pathetic. Initially you will like calling Alexa, but again and again you will get bored. OK no problem, that's the feature. But main issue is it doesn't even play the latest popular songs. Huge disappointment.. I asked to play one song in front of my family, but it started some other music (that was very bad), & then I decided to return it back because I don't want to get insulted. People will laugh on you when you ask calling alexa alexa and it won't play your song.",1.0
2276,"I purchased this product for 3999 rupees. Once i received this product i was very much exited. However that excited didn't last a long. As soon as i started configuring this product, I noticed that WIFI is not at all connecting. Every time, it shows registration failed with some stupid messages. I have wasted hours of time in troubleshooting the problem however nothing didn't worked. Hence i initiated the refund of the money.

I highly recommend DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT, ITS TOTALLY WASTE OF YOUR TIME AND MONEY",1.0
2277,"It is useless device and waste of money it only work with registered WiFi with amazon not with in coming signal of the Alexa app computer or mobile , no one else in the house can use it if registered WiFi is not available and at the same time we can not register two ,three signals . Alexa becomes use less when there is no internet , and there are lot of restrictions like hand free not available when in battery saver mode etc etc . at many a times it can not understand your voice and there are many app's missing in window computer .

if i instruct it to teach Gramer to children it can not do . what a useless device it is , i even wanted to buy Fire TV stick but lots of them in used market ,hence i thought there must be some problem like this in that also hence stopped its purchase .

My advice to Amazon is make it user friendly . do not restrict to one WiFi signal ,Take the in coming signal or allow us to register two ,three signal there should not restrict Hand free etc .

With Regards
